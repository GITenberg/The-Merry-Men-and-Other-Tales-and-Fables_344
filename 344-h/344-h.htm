<h2>THE MERRY MEN</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; EILEAN AROS.</h3>
<p>It was a beautiful morning in the late July when I set forth
on foot for the last time for Aros.&nbsp; A boat had put me
ashore the night before at Grisapol; I had such breakfast as the
little inn afforded, and, leaving all my baggage till I had an
occasion to come round for it by sea, struck right across the
promontory with a cheerful heart.</p>
<p>I was far from being a native of these parts, springing, as I
did, from an unmixed lowland stock.&nbsp; But an uncle of mine,
Gordon Darnaway, after a poor, rough youth, and some years at
sea, had married a young wife in the islands; Mary Maclean she
was called, the last of her family; and when she died in giving
birth to a daughter, Aros, the sea-girt farm, had remained in his
possession.&nbsp; It brought him in nothing but the means of
life, as I was well aware; but he was a man whom ill-fortune had
pursued; he feared, cumbered as he was with the young child, to
make a fresh adventure upon life; and remained in Aros, biting
his nails at destiny.&nbsp; Years passed over his head in that
isolation, and brought neither help nor contentment.&nbsp;
Meantime our family was dying out in the lowlands; there is
little luck for any of that race; and perhaps my father was the
luckiest of all, for not only was he one of the last to die, but
he left a son to his name and a little money to support it.&nbsp;
I was a student of Edinburgh University, living well enough at my
own charges, but without kith or kin; when some news of me found
its way to Uncle Gordon on the Ross of Grisapol; and he, as he
was a man who held blood thicker than water, wrote to me the day
he heard of my existence, and taught me to count Aros as my
home.&nbsp; Thus it was that I came to spend my vacations in that
part of the country, so far from all society and comfort, between
the codfish and the moorcocks; and thus it was that now, when I
had done with my classes, I was returning thither with so light a
heart that July day.</p>
<p>The Ross, as we call it, is a promontory neither wide nor
high, but as rough as God made it to this day; the deep sea on
either hand of it, full of rugged isles and reefs most perilous
to seamen&mdash;all overlooked from the eastward by some very
high cliffs and the great peals of Ben Kyaw.&nbsp; <i>The
Mountain of the Mist</i>, they say the words signify in the
Gaelic tongue; and it is well named.&nbsp; For that hill-top,
which is more than three thousand feet in height, catches all the
clouds that come blowing from the seaward; and, indeed, I used
often to think that it must make them for itself; since when all
heaven was clear to the sea level, there would ever be a streamer
on Ben Kyaw.&nbsp; It brought water, too, and was mossy <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> to the top in consequence.&nbsp; I have
seen us sitting in broad sunshine on the Ross, and the rain
falling black like crape upon the mountain.&nbsp; But the wetness
of it made it often appear more beautiful to my eyes; for when
the sun struck upon the hill sides, there were many wet rocks and
watercourses that shone like jewels even as far as Aros, fifteen
miles away.</p>
<p>The road that I followed was a cattle-track.&nbsp; It twisted
so as nearly to double the length of my journey; it went over
rough boulders so that a man had to leap from one to another, and
through soft bottoms where the moss came nearly to the
knee.&nbsp; There was no cultivation anywhere, and not one house
in the ten miles from Grisapol to Aros.&nbsp; Houses of course
there were&mdash;three at least; but they lay so far on the one
side or the other that no stranger could have found them from the
track.&nbsp; A large part of the Ross is covered with big granite
rocks, some of them larger than a two-roomed house, one beside
another, with fern and deep heather in between them where the
vipers breed.&nbsp; Anyway the wind was, it was always sea air,
as salt as on a ship; the gulls were as free as moorfowl over all
the Ross; and whenever the way rose a little, your eye would
kindle with the brightness of the sea.&nbsp; From the very midst
of the land, on a day of wind and a high spring, I have heard the
Roost roaring, like a battle where it runs by Aros, and the great
and fearful voices of the breakers that we call the Merry
Men.</p>
<p>Aros itself&mdash;Aros Jay, I have heard the natives call it,
and they say it means <i>the House of God</i>&mdash;Aros itself
was not properly a piece of the Ross, nor was it quite an
islet.&nbsp; It formed the south-west corner of the land, fitted
close to it, and was in one place only separated from the coast
by a little gut of the sea, not forty feet across the
narrowest.&nbsp; When the tide was full, this was clear and
still, like a pool on a land river; only there was a difference
in the weeds and fishes, and the water itself was green instead
of brown; but when the tide went out, in the bottom of the ebb,
there was a day or two in every month when you could pass dryshod
from Aros to the mainland.&nbsp; There was some good pasture,
where my uncle fed the sheep he lived on; perhaps the feed was
better because the ground rose higher on the islet than the main
level of the Ross, but this I am not skilled enough to
settle.&nbsp; The house was a good one for that country, two
storeys high.&nbsp; It looked westward over a bay, with a pier
hard by for a boat, and from the door you could watch the vapours
blowing on Ben Kyaw.</p>
<p>On all this part of the coast, and especially near Aros, these
great granite rocks that I have spoken of go down together in
troops into the sea, like cattle on a summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;
There they stand, for all the world like their neighbours ashore;
only the salt water sobbing between them instead of the quiet
earth, and clots of sea-pink blooming on their sides instead of
heather; and the great sea conger to wreathe about the base of
them instead of the poisonous viper of the land.&nbsp; On calm
days you can go wandering between them in a boat for hours,
echoes following you about the labyrinth; but when the sea is up,
Heaven help the man that hears that cauldron boiling.</p>
<p>Off the south-west end of Aros these blocks are very many, and
much greater in size.&nbsp; Indeed, they must grow monstrously
bigger out to sea, for there must be ten sea miles of open water
sown with them as thick as a country place with houses, some
standing thirty feet above the tides, some covered, but all
perilous to ships; so that on a clear, westerly blowing day, I
have counted, from the top of Aros, the great rollers breaking
white and heavy over as many as six-and-forty buried reefs.&nbsp;
But it is nearer in shore that the danger is worst; for the tide,
here running like a mill race, makes a long belt of broken
water&mdash;a <i>Roost</i> we call it&mdash;at the tail of the
land.&nbsp; I have often been out there in a dead calm at the
slack of the tide; and a strange place it is, with the sea
swirling and combing up and boiling like the cauldrons of a linn,
and now and again a little dancing mutter of sound as though the
<i>Roost</i> were talking to itself.&nbsp; But when the tide
begins to run again, and above all in heavy weather, there is no
man could take a boat within half a mile of it, nor a ship afloat
that could either steer or live in such a place.&nbsp; You can
hear the roaring of it six miles away.&nbsp; At the seaward end
there comes the strongest of the bubble; and it&rsquo;s here that
these big breakers dance together&mdash;the dance of death, it
may be called&mdash;that have got the name, in these parts, of
the Merry Men.&nbsp; I have heard it said that they run fifty
feet high; but that must be the green water only, for the spray
runs twice as high as that.&nbsp; Whether they got the name from
their movements, which are swift and antic, or from the shouting
they make about the turn of the tide, so that all Aros shakes
with it, is more than I can tell.</p>
<p>The truth is, that in a south-westerly wind, that part of our
archipelago is no better than a trap.&nbsp; If a ship got through
the reefs, and weathered the Merry Men, it would be to come
ashore on the south coast of Aros, in Sandag Bay, where so many
dismal things befell our family, as I propose to tell.&nbsp; The
thought of all these dangers, in the place I knew so long, makes
me particularly welcome the works now going forward to set lights
upon the headlands and buoys along the channels of our
iron-bound, inhospitable islands.</p>
<p>The country people had many a story about Aros, as I used to
hear from my uncle&rsquo;s man, Rorie, an old servant of the
Macleans, who had transferred his services without afterthought
on the occasion of the marriage.&nbsp; There was some tale of an
unlucky creature, a sea-kelpie, that dwelt and did business in
some fearful manner of his own among the boiling breakers of the
Roost.&nbsp; A mermaid had once met a piper on Sandag beach, and
there sang to him a long, bright midsummer&rsquo;s night, so that
in the morning he was found stricken crazy, and from
thenceforward, till the day he died, said only one form of words;
what they were in the original Gaelic I cannot tell, but they
were thus translated: &lsquo;Ah, the sweet singing out of the
sea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Seals that haunted on that coast have been
known to speak to man in his own tongue, presaging great
disasters.&nbsp; It was here that a certain saint first landed on
his voyage out of Ireland to convert the Hebrideans.&nbsp; And,
indeed, I think he had some claim to be called saint; for, with
the boats of that past age, to make so rough a passage, and land
on such a ticklish coast, was surely not far short of the
miraculous.&nbsp; It was to him, or to some of his monkish
underlings who had a cell there, that the islet owes its holy and
beautiful name, the House of God.</p>
<p>Among these old wives&rsquo; stories there was one which I was
inclined to hear with more credulity.&nbsp; As I was told, in
that tempest which scattered the ships of the Invincible Armada
over all the north and west of Scotland, one great vessel came
ashore on Aros, and before the eyes of some solitary people on a
hill-top, went down in a moment with all hands, her colours
flying even as she sank.&nbsp; There was some likelihood in this
tale; for another of that fleet lay sunk on the north side,
twenty miles from Grisapol.&nbsp; It was told, I thought, with
more detail and gravity than its companion stories, and there was
one particularity which went far to convince me of its truth: the
name, that is, of the ship was still remembered, and sounded, in
my ears, Spanishly.&nbsp; The <i>Espirito Santo</i> they called
it, a great ship of many decks of guns, laden with treasure and
grandees of Spain, and fierce soldadoes, that now lay fathom deep
to all eternity, done with her wars and voyages, in Sandag bay,
upon the west of Aros.&nbsp; No more salvos of ordnance for that
tall ship, the &lsquo;Holy Spirit,&rsquo; no more fair winds or
happy ventures; only to rot there deep in the sea-tangle and hear
the shoutings of the Merry Men as the tide ran high about the
island.&nbsp; It was a strange thought to me first and last, and
only grew stranger as I learned the more of Spain, from which she
had set sail with so proud a company, and King Philip, the
wealthy king, that sent her on that voyage.</p>
<p>And now I must tell you, as I walked from Grisapol that day,
the <i>Espirito Santo</i> was very much in my reflections.&nbsp;
I had been favourably remarked by our then Principal in Edinburgh
College, that famous writer, Dr. Robertson, and by him had been
set to work on some papers of an ancient date to rearrange and
sift of what was worthless; and in one of these, to my great
wonder, I found a note of this very ship, the <i>Espirito
Santo</i>, with her captain&rsquo;s name, and how she carried a
great part of the Spaniard&rsquo;s treasure, and had been lost
upon the Ross of Grisapol; but in what particular spot, the wild
tribes of that place and period would give no information to the
king&rsquo;s inquiries.&nbsp; Putting one thing with another, and
taking our island tradition together with this note of old King
Jamie&rsquo;s perquisitions after wealth, it had come strongly on
my mind that the spot for which he sought in vain could be no
other than the small bay of Sandag on my uncle&rsquo;s land; and
being a fellow of a mechanical turn, I had ever since been
plotting how to weigh that good ship up again with all her
ingots, ounces, and doubloons, and bring back our house of
Darnaway to its long-forgotten dignity and wealth.</p>
<p>This was a design of which I soon had reason to repent.&nbsp;
My mind was sharply turned on different reflections; and since I
became the witness of a strange judgment of God&rsquo;s, the
thought of dead men&rsquo;s treasures has been intolerable to my
conscience.&nbsp; But even at that time I must acquit myself of
sordid greed; for if I desired riches, it was not for their own
sake, but for the sake of a person who was dear to my
heart&mdash;my uncle&rsquo;s daughter, Mary Ellen.&nbsp; She had
been educated well, and had been a time to school upon the
mainland; which, poor girl, she would have been happier
without.&nbsp; For Aros was no place for her, with old Rorie the
servant, and her father, who was one of the unhappiest men in
Scotland, plainly bred up in a country place among Cameronians,
long a skipper sailing out of the Clyde about the islands, and
now, with infinite discontent, managing his sheep and a little
&lsquo;long shore fishing for the necessary bread.&nbsp; If it
was sometimes weariful to me, who was there but a month or two,
you may fancy what it was to her who dwelt in that same desert
all the year round, with the sheep and flying sea-gulls, and the
Merry Men singing and dancing in the Roost!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; WHAT THE WRECK HAD BROUGHT TO AROS.</h3>
<p>It was half-flood when I got the length of Aros; and there was
nothing for it but to stand on the far shore and whistle for
Rorie with the boat.&nbsp; I had no need to repeat the
signal.&nbsp; At the first sound, Mary was at the door flying a
handkerchief by way of answer, and the old long-legged
serving-man was shambling down the gravel to the pier.&nbsp; For
all his hurry, it took him a long while to pull across the bay;
and I observed him several times to pause, go into the stern, and
look over curiously into the wake.&nbsp; As he came nearer, he
seemed to me aged and haggard, and I thought he avoided my
eye.&nbsp; The coble had been repaired, with two new thwarts and
several patches of some rare and beautiful foreign wood, the name
of it unknown to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Rorie,&rsquo; said I, as we began the return
voyage, &lsquo;this is fine wood.&nbsp; How came you by
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be hard to cheesel,&rsquo; Rorie opined
reluctantly; and just then, dropping the oars, he made another of
those dives into the stern which I had remarked as he came across
to fetch me, and, leaning his hand on my shoulder, stared with an
awful look into the waters of the bay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is wrong?&rsquo; I asked, a good deal
startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be a great feesh,&rsquo; said the old man,
returning to his oars; and nothing more could I get out of him,
but strange glances and an ominous nodding of the head.&nbsp; In
spite of myself, I was infected with a measure of uneasiness; I
turned also, and studied the wake.&nbsp; The water was still and
transparent, but, out here in the middle of the bay, exceeding
deep.&nbsp; For some time I could see naught; but at last it did
seem to me as if something dark&mdash;a great fish, or perhaps
only a shadow&mdash;followed studiously in the track of the
moving coble.&nbsp; And then I remembered one of Rorie&rsquo;s
superstitions: how in a ferry in Morven, in some great,
exterminating feud among the clans; a fish, the like of it
unknown in all our waters, followed for some years the passage of
the ferry-boat, until no man dared to make the crossing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will be waiting for the right man,&rsquo; said
Rorie.</p>
<p>Mary met me on the beach, and led me up the brae and into the
house of Aros.&nbsp; Outside and inside there were many
changes.&nbsp; The garden was fenced with the same wood that I
had noted in the boat; there were chairs in the kitchen covered
with strange brocade; curtains of brocade hung from the window; a
clock stood silent on the dresser; a lamp of brass was swinging
from the roof; the table was set for dinner with the finest of
linen and silver; and all these new riches were displayed in the
plain old kitchen that I knew so well, with the high-backed
settle, and the stools, and the closet bed for Rorie; with the
wide chimney the sun shone into, and the clear-smouldering peats;
with the pipes on the mantelshelf and the three-cornered
spittoons, filled with sea-shells instead of sand, on the floor;
with the bare stone walls and the bare wooden floor, and the
three patchwork rugs that were of yore its sole
adornment&mdash;poor man&rsquo;s patchwork, the like of it
unknown in cities, woven with homespun, and Sunday black, and
sea-cloth polished on the bench of rowing.&nbsp; The room, like
the house, had been a sort of wonder in that country-side, it was
so neat and habitable; and to see it now, shamed by these
incongruous additions, filled me with indignation and a kind of
anger.&nbsp; In view of the errand I had come upon to Aros, the
feeling was baseless and unjust; but it burned high, at the first
moment, in my heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary, girl,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is the place I
had learned to call my home, and I do not know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my home by nature, not by the learning,&rsquo;
she replied; &lsquo;the place I was born and the place I&rsquo;m
like to die in; and I neither like these changes, nor the way
they came, nor that which came with them.&nbsp; I would have
liked better, under God&rsquo;s pleasure, they had gone down into
the sea, and the Merry Men were dancing on them now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary was always serious; it was perhaps the only trait that
she shared with her father; but the tone with which she uttered
these words was even graver than of custom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I feared it came by wreck,
and that&rsquo;s by death; yet when my father died, I took his
goods without remorse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father died a clean strae death, as the folk
say,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; I returned; &lsquo;and a wreck is like a
judgment.&nbsp; What was she called?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They ca&rsquo;d her the <i>Christ-Anna</i>,&rsquo; said
a voice behind me; and, turning round, I saw my uncle standing in
the doorway.</p>
<p>He was a sour, small, bilious man, with a long face and very
dark eyes; fifty-six years old, sound and active in body, and
with an air somewhat between that of a shepherd and that of a man
following the sea.&nbsp; He never laughed, that I heard; read
long at the Bible; prayed much, like the Cameronians he had been
brought up among; and indeed, in many ways, used to remind me of
one of the hill-preachers in the killing times before the
Revolution.&nbsp; But he never got much comfort, nor even, as I
used to think, much guidance, by his piety.&nbsp; He had his
black fits when he was afraid of hell; but he had led a rough
life, to which he would look back with envy, and was still a
rough, cold, gloomy man.</p>
<p>As he came in at the door out of the sunlight, with his bonnet
on his head and a pipe hanging in his button-hole, he seemed,
like Rorie, to have grown older and paler, the lines were
deeplier ploughed upon his face, and the whites of his eyes were
yellow, like old stained ivory, or the bones of the dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&rsquo; he repeated, dwelling upon the first part of
the word, &lsquo;the <i>Christ-Anna</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an
awfu&rsquo; name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made him my salutations, and complimented him upon his look
of health; for I feared he had perhaps been ill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in the body,&rsquo; he replied, ungraciously
enough; &lsquo;aye in the body and the sins of the body, like
yoursel&rsquo;.&nbsp; Denner,&rsquo; he said abruptly to Mary,
and then ran on to me: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re grand braws, thir
that we hae gotten, are they no?&nbsp; Yon&rsquo;s a bonny knock
<a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>, but it&rsquo;ll no gang; and the
napery&rsquo;s by ordnar.&nbsp; Bonny, bairnly braws; it&rsquo;s
for the like o&rsquo; them folk sells the peace of God that
passeth understanding; it&rsquo;s for the like o&rsquo; them,
an&rsquo; maybe no even sae muckle worth, folk daunton God to His
face and burn in muckle hell; and it&rsquo;s for that reason the
Scripture ca&rsquo;s them, as I read the passage, the accursed
thing.&nbsp; Mary, ye girzie,&rsquo; he interrupted himself to
cry with some asperity, &lsquo;what for hae ye no put out the twa
candlesticks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should we need them at high noon?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>But my uncle was not to be turned from his idea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll bruik <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> them while we
may,&rsquo; he said; and so two massive candlesticks of wrought
silver were added to the table equipage, already so unsuited to
that rough sea-side farm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She cam&rsquo; ashore Februar&rsquo; 10, about ten at
nicht,&rsquo; he went on to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was nae wind,
and a sair run o&rsquo; sea; and she was in the sook o&rsquo; the
Roost, as I jaloose.&nbsp; We had seen her a&rsquo; day, Rorie
and me, beating to the wind.&nbsp; She wasnae a handy craft,
I&rsquo;m thinking, that <i>Christ-Anna</i>; for she would
neither steer nor stey wi&rsquo; them.&nbsp; A sair day they had
of it; their hands was never aff the sheets, and it
perishin&rsquo; cauld&mdash;ower cauld to snaw; and aye they
would get a bit nip o&rsquo; wind, and awa&rsquo; again, to pit
the emp&rsquo;y hope into them.&nbsp; Eh, man! but they had a
sair day for the last o&rsquo;t!&nbsp; He would have had a prood,
prood heart that won ashore upon the back o&rsquo;
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And were all lost?&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;God
held them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wheesht!&rsquo; he said sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nane
shall pray for the deid on my hearth-stane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I disclaimed a Popish sense for my ejaculation; and he seemed
to accept my disclaimer with unusual facility, and ran on once
more upon what had evidently become a favourite subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We fand her in Sandag Bay, Rorie an&rsquo; me, and
a&rsquo; thae braws in the inside of her.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
kittle bit, ye see, about Sandag; whiles the sook rins strong for
the Merry Men; an&rsquo; whiles again, when the tide&rsquo;s
makin&rsquo; hard an&rsquo; ye can hear the Roost blawin&rsquo;
at the far-end of Aros, there comes a back-spang of current
straucht into Sandag Bay.&nbsp; Weel, there&rsquo;s the thing
that got the grip on the <i>Christ-Anna</i>.&nbsp; She but to
have come in ram-stam an&rsquo; stern forrit; for the bows of her
are aften under, and the back-side of her is clear at hie-water
o&rsquo; neaps.&nbsp; But, man! the dunt that she cam doon
wi&rsquo; when she struck!&nbsp; Lord save us a&rsquo;! but
it&rsquo;s an unco life to be a sailor&mdash;a cauld, wanchancy
life.&nbsp; Mony&rsquo;s the gliff I got mysel&rsquo; in the
great deep; and why the Lord should hae made yon unco water is
mair than ever I could win to understand.&nbsp; He made the vales
and the pastures, the bonny green yaird, the halesome, canty
land&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And now they shout and sing to Thee,<br />
For Thou hast made them glad,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as the Psalms say in the metrical version.&nbsp; No that I
would preen my faith to that clink neither; but it&rsquo;s bonny,
and easier to mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who go to sea in ships,&rdquo;
they hae&rsquo;t again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great waters trading be,<br />
Within the deep these men God&rsquo;s works<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And His great wonders see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weel, it&rsquo;s easy sayin&rsquo; sae.&nbsp; Maybe Dauvit
wasnae very weel acquant wi&rsquo; the sea.&nbsp; But, troth, if
it wasnae prentit in the Bible, I wad whiles be temp&rsquo;it to
think it wasnae the Lord, but the muckle, black deil that made
the sea.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s naething good comes oot o&rsquo;t
but the fish; an&rsquo; the spentacle o&rsquo; God riding on the
tempest, to be shure, whilk would be what Dauvit was likely
ettling at.&nbsp; But, man, they were sair wonders that God
showed to the <i>Christ-Anna</i>&mdash;wonders, do I ca&rsquo;
them?&nbsp; Judgments, rather: judgments in the mirk nicht among
the draygons o&rsquo; the deep.&nbsp; And their souls&mdash;to
think o&rsquo; that&mdash;their souls, man, maybe no
prepared!&nbsp; The sea&mdash;a muckle yett to hell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I observed, as my uncle spoke, that his voice was unnaturally
moved and his manner unwontedly demonstrative.&nbsp; He leaned
forward at these last words, for example, and touched me on the
knee with his spread fingers, looking up into my face with a
certain pallor, and I could see that his eyes shone with a
deep-seated fire, and that the lines about his mouth were drawn
and tremulous.</p>
<p>Even the entrance of Rorie, and the beginning of our meal, did
not detach him from his train of thought beyond a moment.&nbsp;
He condescended, indeed, to ask me some questions as to my
success at college, but I thought it was with half his mind; and
even in his extempore grace, which was, as usual, long and
wandering, I could find the trace of his preoccupation, praying,
as he did, that God would &lsquo;remember in mercy fower puir,
feckless, fiddling, sinful creatures here by their lee-lane
beside the great and dowie waters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Soon there came an interchange of speeches between him and
Rorie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it there?&rsquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ou, ay!&rsquo; said Rorie.</p>
<p>I observed that they both spoke in a manner of aside, and with
some show of embarrassment, and that Mary herself appeared to
colour, and looked down on her plate.&nbsp; Partly to show my
knowledge, and so relieve the party from an awkward strain,
partly because I was curious, I pursued the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean the fish?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatten fish?&rsquo; cried my uncle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fish,
quo&rsquo; he!&nbsp; Fish!&nbsp; Your een are fu&rsquo; o&rsquo;
fatness, man; your heid dozened wi&rsquo; carnal leir.&nbsp;
Fish! it&rsquo;s a bogle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with great vehemence, as though angry; and perhaps I
was not very willing to be put down so shortly, for young men are
disputatious.&nbsp; At least I remember I retorted hotly, crying
out upon childish superstitions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And ye come frae the College!&rsquo; sneered Uncle
Gordon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gude kens what they learn folk there;
it&rsquo;s no muckle service onyway.&nbsp; Do ye think, man, that
there&rsquo;s naething in a&rsquo; yon saut wilderness o&rsquo; a
world oot wast there, wi&rsquo; the sea grasses growin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; the sea beasts fechtin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the sun
glintin&rsquo; down into it, day by day?&nbsp; Na; the
sea&rsquo;s like the land, but fearsomer.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s
folk ashore, there&rsquo;s folk in the sea&mdash;deid they may
be, but they&rsquo;re folk whatever; and as for deils,
there&rsquo;s nane that&rsquo;s like the sea deils.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no sae muckle harm in the land deils, when
a&rsquo;s said and done.&nbsp; Lang syne, when I was a callant in
the south country, I mind there was an auld, bald bogle in the
Peewie Moss.&nbsp; I got a glisk o&rsquo; him mysel&rsquo;,
sittin&rsquo; on his hunkers in a hag, as gray&rsquo;s a
tombstane.&nbsp; An&rsquo;, troth, he was a fearsome-like
taed.&nbsp; But he steered naebody.&nbsp; Nae doobt, if ane that
was a reprobate, ane the Lord hated, had gane by there wi&rsquo;
his sin still upon his stamach, nae doobt the creature would hae
lowped upo&rsquo; the likes o&rsquo; him.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s
deils in the deep sea would yoke on a communicant!&nbsp; Eh,
sirs, if ye had gane doon wi&rsquo; the puir lads in the
<i>Christ-Anna</i>, ye would ken by now the mercy o&rsquo; the
seas.&nbsp; If ye had sailed it for as lang as me, ye would hate
the thocht of it as I do.&nbsp; If ye had but used the een God
gave ye, ye would hae learned the wickedness o&rsquo; that fause,
saut, cauld, bullering creature, and of a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s in
it by the Lord&rsquo;s permission: labsters an&rsquo; partans,
an&rsquo; sic like, howking in the deid; muckle, gutsy, blawing
whales; an&rsquo; fish&mdash;the hale clan o&rsquo;
them&mdash;cauld-wamed, blind-eed uncanny ferlies.&nbsp; O,
sirs,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;the horror&mdash;the horror
o&rsquo; the sea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We were all somewhat staggered by this outburst; and the
speaker himself, after that last hoarse apostrophe, appeared to
sink gloomily into his own thoughts.&nbsp; But Rorie, who was
greedy of superstitious lore, recalled him to the subject by a
question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not ever have seen a teevil of the sea?&rsquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No clearly,&rsquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
misdoobt if a mere man could see ane clearly and conteenue in the
body.&nbsp; I hae sailed wi&rsquo; a lad&mdash;they ca&rsquo;d
him Sandy Gabart; he saw ane, shure eneueh, an&rsquo; shure
eneueh it was the end of him.&nbsp; We were seeven days oot frae
the Clyde&mdash;a sair wark we had had&mdash;gaun north wi&rsquo;
seeds an&rsquo; braws an&rsquo; things for the Macleod.&nbsp; We
had got in ower near under the Cutchull&rsquo;ns, an&rsquo; had
just gane about by soa, an&rsquo; were off on a lang tack, we
thocht would maybe hauld as far&rsquo;s Copnahow.&nbsp; I mind
the nicht weel; a mune smoored wi&rsquo; mist; a fine gaun breeze
upon the water, but no steedy; an&rsquo;&mdash;what nane o&rsquo;
us likit to hear&mdash;anither wund gurlin&rsquo; owerheid, amang
thae fearsome, auld stane craigs o&rsquo; the
Cutchull&rsquo;ns.&nbsp; Weel, Sandy was forrit wi&rsquo; the jib
sheet; we couldnae see him for the mains&rsquo;l, that had just
begude to draw, when a&rsquo; at ance he gied a skirl.&nbsp; I
luffed for my life, for I thocht we were ower near Soa; but na,
it wasnae that, it was puir Sandy Gabart&rsquo;s deid skreigh, or
near hand, for he was deid in half an hour.&nbsp; A&rsquo;t he
could tell was that a sea deil, or sea bogle, or sea spenster, or
sic-like, had clum up by the bowsprit, an&rsquo; gi&rsquo;en him
ae cauld, uncanny look.&nbsp; An&rsquo;, or the life was oot
o&rsquo; Sandy&rsquo;s body, we kent weel what the thing
betokened, and why the wund gurled in the taps o&rsquo; the
Cutchull&rsquo;ns; for doon it cam&rsquo;&mdash;a wund do I
ca&rsquo; it! it was the wund o&rsquo; the Lord&rsquo;s
anger&mdash;an&rsquo; a&rsquo; that nicht we foucht like men
dementit, and the niest that we kenned we were ashore in Loch
Uskevagh, an&rsquo; the cocks were crawin&rsquo; in
Benbecula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will have been a merman,&rsquo; Rorie said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A merman!&rsquo; screamed my uncle with immeasurable
scorn.&nbsp; &lsquo;Auld wives&rsquo; clavers!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nae sic things as mermen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what was the creature like?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What like was it?&nbsp; Gude forbid that we suld ken
what like it was!&nbsp; It had a kind of a heid upon it&mdash;man
could say nae mair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Rorie, smarting under the affront, told several tales of
mermen, mermaids, and sea-horses that had come ashore upon the
islands and attacked the crews of boats upon the sea; and my
uncle, in spite of his incredulity, listened with uneasy
interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aweel, aweel,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it may be sae; I
may be wrang; but I find nae word o&rsquo; mermen in the
Scriptures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will find nae word of Aros Roost, maybe,&rsquo;
objected Rorie, and his argument appeared to carry weight.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, my uncle carried me forth with him to a
bank behind the house.&nbsp; It was a very hot and quiet
afternoon; scarce a ripple anywhere upon the sea, nor any voice
but the familiar voice of sheep and gulls; and perhaps in
consequence of this repose in nature, my kinsman showed himself
more rational and tranquil than before.&nbsp; He spoke evenly and
almost cheerfully of my career, with every now and then a
reference to the lost ship or the treasures it had brought to
Aros.&nbsp; For my part, I listened to him in a sort of trance,
gazing with all my heart on that remembered scene, and drinking
gladly the sea-air and the smoke of peats that had been lit by
Mary.</p>
<p>Perhaps an hour had passed when my uncle, who had all the
while been covertly gazing on the surface of the little bay, rose
to his feet and bade me follow his example.&nbsp; Now I should
say that the great run of tide at the south-west end of Aros
exercises a perturbing influence round all the coast.&nbsp; In
Sandag Bay, to the south, a strong current runs at certain
periods of the flood and ebb respectively; but in this northern
bay&mdash;Aros Bay, as it is called&mdash;where the house stands
and on which my uncle was now gazing, the only sign of
disturbance is towards the end of the ebb, and even then it is
too slight to be remarkable.&nbsp; When there is any swell,
nothing can be seen at all; but when it is calm, as it often is,
there appear certain strange, undecipherable
marks&mdash;sea-runes, as we may name them&mdash;on the glassy
surface of the bay.&nbsp; The like is common in a thousand places
on the coast; and many a boy must have amused himself as I did,
seeking to read in them some reference to himself or those he
loved.&nbsp; It was to these marks that my uncle now directed my
attention, struggling, as he did so, with an evident
reluctance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do ye see yon scart upo&rsquo; the water?&rsquo; he
inquired; &lsquo;yon ane wast the gray stane?&nbsp; Ay?&nbsp;
Weel, it&rsquo;ll no be like a letter, wull it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly it is,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
often remarked it.&nbsp; It is like a C.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He heaved a sigh as if heavily disappointed with my answer,
and then added below his breath: &lsquo;Ay, for the
<i>Christ-Anna</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I used to suppose, sir, it was for myself,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;for my name is Charles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so ye saw&rsquo;t afore?&rsquo;, he ran on, not
heeding my remark.&nbsp; &lsquo;Weel, weel, but that&rsquo;s unco
strange.&nbsp; Maybe, it&rsquo;s been there waitin&rsquo;, as a
man wad say, through a&rsquo; the weary ages.&nbsp; Man, but
that&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, breaking off:
&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no see anither, will ye?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see another very
plainly, near the Ross side, where the road comes down&mdash;an
M.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An M,&rsquo; he repeated very low; and then, again
after another pause: &lsquo;An&rsquo; what wad ye make o&rsquo;
that?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had always thought it to mean Mary, sir,&rsquo; I
answered, growing somewhat red, convinced as I was in my own mind
that I was on the threshold of a decisive explanation.</p>
<p>But we were each following his own train of thought to the
exclusion of the other&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My uncle once more paid no
attention to my words; only hung his head and held his peace; and
I might have been led to fancy that he had not heard me, if his
next speech had not contained a kind of echo from my own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would say naething o&rsquo; thae clavers to
Mary,&rsquo; he observed, and began to walk forward.</p>
<p>There is a belt of turf along the side of Aros Bay, where
walking is easy; and it was along this that I silently followed
my silent kinsman.&nbsp; I was perhaps a little disappointed at
having lost so good an opportunity to declare my love; but I was
at the same time far more deeply exercised at the change that had
befallen my uncle.&nbsp; He was never an ordinary, never, in the
strict sense, an amiable, man; but there was nothing in even the
worst that I had known of him before, to prepare me for so
strange a transformation.&nbsp; It was impossible to close the
eyes against one fact; that he had, as the saying goes, something
on his mind; and as I mentally ran over the different words which
might be represented by the letter M&mdash;misery, mercy,
marriage, money, and the like&mdash;I was arrested with a sort of
start by the word murder.&nbsp; I was still considering the ugly
sound and fatal meaning of the word, when the direction of our
walk brought us to a point from which a view was to be had to
either side, back towards Aros Bay and homestead, and forward on
the ocean, dotted to the north with isles, and lying to the
southward blue and open to the sky.&nbsp; There my guide came to
a halt, and stood staring for awhile on that expanse.&nbsp; Then
he turned to me and laid a hand on my arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye think there&rsquo;s naething there?&rsquo; he said,
pointing with his pipe; and then cried out aloud, with a kind of
exultation: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye, man!&nbsp; The deid are
down there&mdash;thick like rattons!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned at once, and, without another word, we retraced our
steps to the house of Aros.</p>
<p>I was eager to be alone with Mary; yet it was not till after
supper, and then but for a short while, that I could have a word
with her.&nbsp; I lost no time beating about the bush, but spoke
out plainly what was on my mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have not come to Aros
without a hope.&nbsp; If that should prove well founded, we may
all leave and go somewhere else, secure of daily bread and
comfort; secure, perhaps, of something far beyond that, which it
would seem extravagant in me to promise.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s
a hope that lies nearer to my heart than money.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
at that I paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can guess fine what that is,
Mary,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; She looked away from me in silence,
and that was small encouragement, but I was not to be put
off.&nbsp; &lsquo;All my days I have thought the world of
you,&rsquo; I continued; &lsquo;the time goes on and I think
always the more of you; I could not think to be happy or hearty
in my life without you: you are the apple of my eye.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Still she looked away, and said never a word; but I thought I saw
that her hands shook.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I cried in fear,
&lsquo;do ye no like me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Charlie man,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is this a time
to speak of it?&nbsp; Let me be, a while; let me be the way I am;
it&rsquo;ll not be you that loses by the waiting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made out by her voice that she was nearly weeping, and this
put me out of any thought but to compose her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary
Ellen,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;say no more; I did not come to
trouble you: your way shall be mine, and your time too; and you
have told me all I wanted.&nbsp; Only just this one thing more:
what ails you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She owned it was her father, but would enter into no
particulars, only shook her head, and said he was not well and
not like himself, and it was a great pity.&nbsp; She knew nothing
of the wreck.&nbsp; &lsquo;I havenae been near it,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;What for would I go near it, Charlie lad?&nbsp;
The poor souls are gone to their account long syne; and I would
just have wished they had ta&rsquo;en their gear with
them&mdash;poor souls!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was scarcely any great encouragement for me to tell her
of the <i>Espirito Santo</i>; yet I did so, and at the very first
word she cried out in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was a man at
Grisapol,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in the month of May&mdash;a
little, yellow, black-avised body, they tell me, with gold rings
upon his fingers, and a beard; and he was speiring high and low
for that same ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was towards the end of April that I had been given these
papers to sort out by Dr. Robertson: and it came suddenly back
upon my mind that they were thus prepared for a Spanish
historian, or a man calling himself such, who had come with high
recommendations to the Principal, on a mission of inquiry as to
the dispersion of the great Armada.&nbsp; Putting one thing with
another, I fancied that the visitor &lsquo;with the gold rings
upon his fingers&rsquo; might be the same with Dr.
Robertson&rsquo;s historian from Madrid.&nbsp; If that were so,
he would be more likely after treasure for himself than
information for a learned society.&nbsp; I made up my mind, I
should lose no time over my undertaking; and if the ship lay sunk
in Sandag Bay, as perhaps both he and I supposed, it should not
be for the advantage of this ringed adventurer, but for Mary and
myself, and for the good, old, honest, kindly family of the
Darnaways.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; LAND AND SEA IN SANDAG BAY.</h3>
<p>I was early afoot next morning; and as soon as I had a bite to
eat, set forth upon a tour of exploration.&nbsp; Something in my
heart distinctly told me that I should find the ship of the
Armada; and although I did not give way entirely to such hopeful
thoughts, I was still very light in spirits and walked upon
air.&nbsp; Aros is a very rough islet, its surface strewn with
great rocks and shaggy with fernland heather; and my way lay
almost north and south across the highest knoll; and though the
whole distance was inside of two miles it took more time and
exertion than four upon a level road.&nbsp; Upon the summit, I
paused.&nbsp; Although not very high&mdash;not three hundred
feet, as I think&mdash;it yet outtops all the neighbouring
lowlands of the Ross, and commands a great view of sea and
islands.&nbsp; The sun, which had been up some time, was already
hot upon my neck; the air was listless and thundery, although
purely clear; away over the north-west, where the isles lie
thickliest congregated, some half-a-dozen small and ragged clouds
hung together in a covey; and the head of Ben Kyaw wore, not
merely a few streamers, but a solid hood of vapour.&nbsp; There
was a threat in the weather.&nbsp; The sea, it is true, was
smooth like glass: even the Roost was but a seam on that wide
mirror, and the Merry Men no more than caps of foam; but to my
eye and ear, so long familiar with these places, the sea also
seemed to lie uneasily; a sound of it, like a long sigh, mounted
to me where I stood; and, quiet as it was, the Roost itself
appeared to be revolving mischief.&nbsp; For I ought to say that
all we dwellers in these parts attributed, if not prescience, at
least a quality of warning, to that strange and dangerous
creature of the tides.</p>
<p>I hurried on, then, with the greater speed, and had soon
descended the slope of Aros to the part that we call Sandag
Bay.&nbsp; It is a pretty large piece of water compared with the
size of the isle; well sheltered from all but the prevailing
wind; sandy and shoal and bounded by low sand-hills to the west,
but to the eastward lying several fathoms deep along a ledge of
rocks.&nbsp; It is upon that side that, at a certain time each
flood, the current mentioned by my uncle sets so strong into the
bay; a little later, when the Roost begins to work higher, an
undertow runs still more strongly in the reverse direction; and
it is the action of this last, as I suppose, that has scoured
that part so deep.&nbsp; Nothing is to be seen out of Sandag Bay,
but one small segment of the horizon and, in heavy weather, the
breakers flying high over a deep sea reef.</p>
<p>From half-way down the hill, I had perceived the wreck of
February last, a brig of considerable tonnage, lying, with her
back broken, high and dry on the east corner of the sands; and I
was making directly towards it, and already almost on the margin
of the turf, when my eyes were suddenly arrested by a spot,
cleared of fern and heather, and marked by one of those long,
low, and almost human-looking mounds that we see so commonly in
graveyards.&nbsp; I stopped like a man shot.&nbsp; Nothing had
been said to me of any dead man or interment on the island;
Rorie, Mary, and my uncle had all equally held their peace; of
her at least, I was certain that she must be ignorant; and yet
here, before my eyes, was proof indubitable of the fact.&nbsp;
Here was a grave; and I had to ask myself, with a chill, what
manner of man lay there in his last sleep, awaiting the signal of
the Lord in that solitary, sea-beat resting-place?&nbsp; My mind
supplied no answer but what I feared to entertain.&nbsp;
Shipwrecked, at least, he must have been; perhaps, like the old
Armada mariners, from some far and rich land over-sea; or perhaps
one of my own race, perishing within eyesight of the smoke of
home.&nbsp; I stood awhile uncovered by his side, and I could
have desired that it had lain in our religion to put up some
prayer for that unhappy stranger, or, in the old classic way,
outwardly to honour his misfortune.&nbsp; I knew, although his
bones lay there, a part of Aros, till the trumpet sounded, his
imperishable soul was forth and far away, among the raptures of
the everlasting Sabbath or the pangs of hell; and yet my mind
misgave me even with a fear, that perhaps he was near me where I
stood, guarding his sepulchre, and lingering on the scene of his
unhappy fate.</p>
<p>Certainly it was with a spirit somewhat over-shadowed that I
turned away from the grave to the hardly less melancholy
spectacle of the wreck.&nbsp; Her stem was above the first arc of
the flood; she was broken in two a little abaft the
foremast&mdash;though indeed she had none, both masts having
broken short in her disaster; and as the pitch of the beach was
very sharp and sudden, and the bows lay many feet below the
stern, the fracture gaped widely open, and you could see right
through her poor hull upon the farther side.&nbsp; Her name was
much defaced, and I could not make out clearly whether she was
called <i>Christiania</i>, after the Norwegian city, or
<i>Christiana</i>, after the good woman, Christian&rsquo;s wife,
in that old book the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rsquo;&nbsp; By her build she was a foreign ship, but I
was not certain of her nationality.&nbsp; She had been painted
green, but the colour was faded and weathered, and the paint
peeling off in strips.&nbsp; The wreck of the mainmast lay
alongside, half buried in sand.&nbsp; She was a forlorn sight,
indeed, and I could not look without emotion at the bits of rope
that still hung about her, so often handled of yore by shouting
seamen; or the little scuttle where they had passed up and down
to their affairs; or that poor noseless angel of a figure-head
that had dipped into so many running billows.</p>
<p>I do not know whether it came most from the ship or from the
grave, but I fell into some melancholy scruples, as I stood
there, leaning with one hand against the battered timbers.&nbsp;
The homelessness of men and even of inanimate vessels, cast away
upon strange shores, came strongly in upon my mind.&nbsp; To make
a profit of such pitiful misadventures seemed an unmanly and a
sordid act; and I began to think of my then quest as of something
sacrilegious in its nature.&nbsp; But when I remembered Mary, I
took heart again.&nbsp; My uncle would never consent to an
imprudent marriage, nor would she, as I was persuaded, wed
without his full approval.&nbsp; It behoved me, then, to be up
and doing for my wife; and I thought with a laugh how long it was
since that great sea-castle, the <i>Espirito Santo</i>, had left
her bones in Sandag Bay, and how weak it would be to consider
rights so long extinguished and misfortunes so long forgotten in
the process of time.</p>
<p>I had my theory of where to seek for her remains.&nbsp; The
set of the current and the soundings both pointed to the east
side of the bay under the ledge of rocks.&nbsp; If she had been
lost in Sandag Bay, and if, after these centuries, any portion of
her held together, it was there that I should find it.&nbsp; The
water deepens, as I have said, with great rapidity, and even
close along-side the rocks several fathoms may be found.&nbsp; As
I walked upon the edge I could see far and wide over the sandy
bottom of the bay; the sun shone clear and green and steady in
the deeps; the bay seemed rather like a great transparent
crystal, as one sees them in a lapidary&rsquo;s shop; there was
naught to show that it was water but an internal trembling, a
hovering within of sun-glints and netted shadows, and now and
then a faint lap and a dying bubble round the edge.&nbsp; The
shadows of the rocks lay out for some distance at their feet, so
that my own shadow, moving, pausing, and stooping on the top of
that, reached sometimes half across the bay.&nbsp; It was above
all in this belt of shadows that I hunted for the <i>Espirito
Santo</i>; since it was there the undertow ran strongest, whether
in or out.&nbsp; Cool as the whole water seemed this broiling
day, it looked, in that part, yet cooler, and had a mysterious
invitation for the eyes.&nbsp; Peer as I pleased, however, I
could see nothing but a few fishes or a bush of sea-tangle, and
here and there a lump of rock that had fallen from above and now
lay separate on the sandy floor.&nbsp; Twice did I pass from one
end to the other of the rocks, and in the whole distance I could
see nothing of the wreck, nor any place but one where it was
possible for it to be.&nbsp; This was a large terrace in five
fathoms of water, raised off the surface of the sand to a
considerable height, and looking from above like a mere outgrowth
of the rocks on which I walked.&nbsp; It was one mass of great
sea-tangles like a grove, which prevented me judging of its
nature, but in shape and size it bore some likeness to a
vessel&rsquo;s hull.&nbsp; At least it was my best chance.&nbsp;
If the <i>Espirito Santo</i> lay not there under the tangles, it
lay nowhere at all in Sandag Bay; and I prepared to put the
question to the proof, once and for all, and either go back to
Aros a rich man or cured for ever of my dreams of wealth.</p>
<p>I stripped to the skin, and stood on the extreme margin with
my hands clasped, irresolute.&nbsp; The bay at that time was
utterly quiet; there was no sound but from a school of porpoises
somewhere out of sight behind the point; yet a certain fear
withheld me on the threshold of my venture.&nbsp; Sad
sea-feelings, scraps of my uncle&rsquo;s superstitions, thoughts
of the dead, of the grave, of the old broken ships, drifted
through my mind.&nbsp; But the strong sun upon my shoulders
warmed me to the heart, and I stooped forward and plunged into
the sea.</p>
<p>It was all that I could do to catch a trail of the sea-tangle
that grew so thickly on the terrace; but once so far anchored I
secured myself by grasping a whole armful of these thick and
slimy stalks, and, planting my feet against the edge, I looked
around me.&nbsp; On all sides the clear sand stretched forth
unbroken; it came to the foot of the rocks, scoured into the
likeness of an alley in a garden by the action of the tides; and
before me, for as far as I could see, nothing was visible but the
same many-folded sand upon the sun-bright bottom of the
bay.&nbsp; Yet the terrace to which I was then holding was as
thick with strong sea-growths as a tuft of heather, and the cliff
from which it bulged hung draped below the water-line with brown
lianas.&nbsp; In this complexity of forms, all swaying together
in the current, things were hard to be distinguished; and I was
still uncertain whether my feet were pressed upon the natural
rock or upon the timbers of the Armada treasure-ship, when the
whole tuft of tangle came away in my hand, and in an instant I
was on the surface, and the shores of the bay and the bright
water swam before my eyes in a glory of crimson.</p>
<p>I clambered back upon the rocks, and threw the plant of tangle
at my feet.&nbsp; Something at the same moment rang sharply, like
a falling coin.&nbsp; I stooped, and there, sure enough, crusted
with the red rust, there lay an iron shoe-buckle.&nbsp; The sight
of this poor human relic thrilled me to the heart, but not with
hope nor fear, only with a desolate melancholy.&nbsp; I held it
in my hand, and the thought of its owner appeared before me like
the presence of an actual man.&nbsp; His weather-beaten face, his
sailor&rsquo;s hands, his sea-voice hoarse with singing at the
capstan, the very foot that had once worn that buckle and trod so
much along the swerving decks&mdash;the whole human fact of him,
as a creature like myself, with hair and blood and seeing eyes,
haunted me in that sunny, solitary place, not like a spectre, but
like some friend whom I had basely injured.&nbsp; Was the great
treasure ship indeed below there, with her guns and chain and
treasure, as she had sailed from Spain; her decks a garden for
the seaweed, her cabin a breeding place for fish, soundless but
for the dredging water, motionless but for the waving of the
tangle upon her battlements&mdash;that old, populous, sea-riding
castle, now a reef in Sandag Bay?&nbsp; Or, as I thought it
likelier, was this a waif from the disaster of the foreign
brig&mdash;was this shoe-buckle bought but the other day and worn
by a man of my own period in the world&rsquo;s history, hearing
the same news from day to day, thinking the same thoughts,
praying, perhaps, in the same temple with myself?&nbsp; However
it was, I was assailed with dreary thoughts; my uncle&rsquo;s
words, &lsquo;the dead are down there,&rsquo; echoed in my ears;
and though I determined to dive once more, it was with a strong
repugnance that I stepped forward to the margin of the rocks.</p>
<p>A great change passed at that moment over the appearance of
the bay.&nbsp; It was no more that clear, visible interior, like
a house roofed with glass, where the green, submarine sunshine
slept so stilly.&nbsp; A breeze, I suppose, had flawed the
surface, and a sort of trouble and blackness filled its bosom,
where flashes of light and clouds of shadow tossed confusedly
together.&nbsp; Even the terrace below obscurely rocked and
quivered.&nbsp; It seemed a graver thing to venture on this place
of ambushes; and when I leaped into the sea the second time it
was with a quaking in my soul.</p>
<p>I secured myself as at first, and groped among the waving
tangle.&nbsp; All that met my touch was cold and soft and
gluey.&nbsp; The thicket was alive with crabs and lobsters,
trundling to and fro lopsidedly, and I had to harden my heart
against the horror of their carrion neighbourhood.&nbsp; On all
sides I could feel the grain and the clefts of hard, living
stone; no planks, no iron, not a sign of any wreck; the
<i>Espirito Santo</i> was not there.&nbsp; I remember I had
almost a sense of relief in my disappointment, and I was about
ready to leave go, when something happened that sent me to the
surface with my heart in my mouth.&nbsp; I had already stayed
somewhat late over my explorations; the current was freshening
with the change of the tide, and Sandag Bay was no longer a safe
place for a single swimmer.&nbsp; Well, just at the last moment
there came a sudden flush of current, dredging through the
tangles like a wave.&nbsp; I lost one hold, was flung sprawling
on my side, and, instinctively grasping for a fresh support, my
fingers closed on something hard and cold.&nbsp; I think I knew
at that moment what it was.&nbsp; At least I instantly left hold
of the tangle, leaped for the surface, and clambered out next
moment on the friendly rocks with the bone of a man&rsquo;s leg
in my grasp.</p>
<p>Mankind is a material creature, slow to think and dull to
perceive connections.&nbsp; The grave, the wreck of the brig, and
the rusty shoe-buckle were surely plain advertisements.&nbsp; A
child might have read their dismal story, and yet it was not
until I touched that actual piece of mankind that the full horror
of the charnel ocean burst upon my spirit.&nbsp; I laid the bone
beside the buckle, picked up my clothes, and ran as I was along
the rocks towards the human shore.&nbsp; I could not be far
enough from the spot; no fortune was vast enough to tempt me back
again.&nbsp; The bones of the drowned dead should henceforth roll
undisturbed by me, whether on tangle or minted gold.&nbsp; But as
soon as I trod the good earth again, and had covered my nakedness
against the sun, I knelt down over against the ruins of the brig,
and out of the fulness of my heart prayed long and passionately
for all poor souls upon the sea.&nbsp; A generous prayer is never
presented in vain; the petition may be refused, but the
petitioner is always, I believe, rewarded by some gracious
visitation.&nbsp; The horror, at least, was lifted from my mind;
I could look with calm of spirit on that great bright creature,
God&rsquo;s ocean; and as I set off homeward up the rough sides
of Aros, nothing remained of my concern beyond a deep
determination to meddle no more with the spoils of wrecked
vessels or the treasures of the dead.</p>
<p>I was already some way up the hill before I paused to breathe
and look behind me.&nbsp; The sight that met my eyes was doubly
strange.</p>
<p>For, first, the storm that I had foreseen was now advancing
with almost tropical rapidity.&nbsp; The whole surface of the sea
had been dulled from its conspicuous brightness to an ugly hue of
corrugated lead; already in the distance the white waves, the
&lsquo;skipper&rsquo;s daughters,&rsquo; had begun to flee before
a breeze that was still insensible on Aros; and already along the
curve of Sandag Bay there was a splashing run of sea that I could
hear from where I stood.&nbsp; The change upon the sky was even
more remarkable.&nbsp; There had begun to arise out of the
south-west a huge and solid continent of scowling cloud; here and
there, through rents in its contexture, the sun still poured a
sheaf of spreading rays; and here and there, from all its edges,
vast inky streamers lay forth along the yet unclouded sky.&nbsp;
The menace was express and imminent.&nbsp; Even as I gazed, the
sun was blotted out.&nbsp; At any moment the tempest might fall
upon Aros in its might.</p>
<p>The suddenness of this change of weather so fixed my eyes on
heaven that it was some seconds before they alighted on the bay,
mapped out below my feet, and robbed a moment later of the
sun.&nbsp; The knoll which I had just surmounted overflanked a
little amphitheatre of lower hillocks sloping towards the sea,
and beyond that the yellow arc of beach and the whole extent of
Sandag Bay.&nbsp; It was a scene on which I had often looked
down, but where I had never before beheld a human figure.&nbsp; I
had but just turned my back upon it and left it empty, and my
wonder may be fancied when I saw a boat and several men in that
deserted spot.&nbsp; The boat was lying by the rocks.&nbsp; A
pair of fellows, bareheaded, with their sleeves rolled up, and
one with a boathook, kept her with difficulty to her moorings for
the current was growing brisker every moment.&nbsp; A little way
off upon the ledge two men in black clothes, whom I judged to be
superior in rank, laid their heads together over some task which
at first I did not understand, but a second after I had made it
out&mdash;they were taking bearings with the compass; and just
then I saw one of them unroll a sheet of paper and lay his finger
down, as though identifying features in a map.&nbsp; Meanwhile a
third was walking to and fro, polling among the rocks and peering
over the edge into the water.&nbsp; While I was still watching
them with the stupefaction of surprise, my mind hardly yet able
to work on what my eyes reported, this third person suddenly
stooped and summoned his companions with a cry so loud that it
reached my ears upon the hill.&nbsp; The others ran to him, even
dropping the compass in their hurry, and I could see the bone and
the shoe-buckle going from hand to hand, causing the most unusual
gesticulations of surprise and interest.&nbsp; Just then I could
hear the seamen crying from the boat, and saw them point westward
to that cloud continent which was ever the more rapidly unfurling
its blackness over heaven.&nbsp; The others seemed to consult;
but the danger was too pressing to be braved, and they bundled
into the boat carrying my relies with them, and set forth out of
the bay with all speed of oars.</p>
<p>I made no more ado about the matter, but turned and ran for
the house.&nbsp; Whoever these men were, it was fit my uncle
should be instantly informed.&nbsp; It was not then altogether
too late in the day for a descent of the Jacobites; and may be
Prince Charlie, whom I knew my uncle to detest, was one of the
three superiors whom I had seen upon the rock.&nbsp; Yet as I
ran, leaping from rock to rock, and turned the matter loosely in
my mind, this theory grew ever the longer the less welcome to my
reason.&nbsp; The compass, the map, the interest awakened by the
buckle, and the conduct of that one among the strangers who had
looked so often below him in the water, all seemed to point to a
different explanation of their presence on that outlying, obscure
islet of the western sea.&nbsp; The Madrid historian, the search
instituted by Dr. Robertson, the bearded stranger with the rings,
my own fruitless search that very morning in the deep water of
Sandag Bay, ran together, piece by piece, in my memory, and I
made sure that these strangers must be Spaniards in quest of
ancient treasure and the lost ship of the Armada.&nbsp; But the
people living in outlying islands, such as Aros, are answerable
for their own security; there is none near by to protect or even
to help them; and the presence in such a spot of a crew of
foreign adventurers&mdash;poor, greedy, and most likely
lawless&mdash;filled me with apprehensions for my uncle&rsquo;s
money, and even for the safety of his daughter.&nbsp; I was still
wondering how we were to get rid of them when I came, all
breathless, to the top of Aros.&nbsp; The whole world was
shadowed over; only in the extreme east, on a hill of the
mainland, one last gleam of sunshine lingered like a jewel; rain
had begun to fall, not heavily, but in great drops; the sea was
rising with each moment, and already a band of white encircled
Aros and the nearer coasts of Grisapol.&nbsp; The boat was still
pulling seaward, but I now became aware of what had been hidden
from me lower down&mdash;a large, heavily sparred, handsome
schooner, lying to at the south end of Aros.&nbsp; Since I had
not seen her in the morning when I had looked around so closely
at the signs of the weather, and upon these lone waters where a
sail was rarely visible, it was clear she must have lain last
night behind the uninhabited Eilean Gour, and this proved
conclusively that she was manned by strangers to our coast, for
that anchorage, though good enough to look at, is little better
than a trap for ships.&nbsp; With such ignorant sailors upon so
wild a coast, the coming gale was not unlikely to bring death
upon its wings.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE GALE.</h3>
<p>I found my uncle at the gable end, watching the signs of the
weather, with a pipe in his fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there were men ashore at
Sandag Bay&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had no time to go further; indeed, I not only forgot my
words, but even my weariness, so strange was the effect on Uncle
Gordon.&nbsp; He dropped his pipe and fell back against the end
of the house with his jaw fallen, his eyes staring, and his long
face as white as paper.&nbsp; We must have looked at one another
silently for a quarter of a minute, before he made answer in this
extraordinary fashion: &lsquo;Had he a hair kep on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I knew as well as if I had been there that the man who now lay
buried at Sandag had worn a hairy cap, and that he had come
ashore alive.&nbsp; For the first and only time I lost toleration
for the man who was my benefactor and the father of the woman I
hoped to call my wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These were living men,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;perhaps
Jacobites, perhaps the French, perhaps pirates, perhaps
adventurers come here to seek the Spanish treasure ship; but,
whatever they may be, dangerous at least to your daughter and my
cousin.&nbsp; As for your own guilty terrors, man, the dead
sleeps well where you have laid him.&nbsp; I stood this morning
by his grave; he will not wake before the trump of
doom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My kinsman looked upon me, blinking, while I spoke; then he
fixed his eyes for a little on the ground, and pulled his fingers
foolishly; but it was plain that he was past the power of
speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must think for
others.&nbsp; You must come up the hill with me, and see this
ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed without a word or a look, following slowly after my
impatient strides.&nbsp; The spring seemed to have gone out of
his body, and he scrambled heavily up and down the rocks, instead
of leaping, as he was wont, from one to another.&nbsp; Nor could
I, for all my cries, induce him to make better haste.&nbsp; Only
once he replied to me complainingly, and like one in bodily pain:
&lsquo;Ay, ay, man, I&rsquo;m coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; Long before we
had reached the top, I had no other thought for him but
pity.&nbsp; If the crime had been monstrous the punishment was in
proportion.</p>
<p>At last we emerged above the sky-line of the hill, and could
see around us.&nbsp; All was black and stormy to the eye; the
last gleam of sun had vanished; a wind had sprung up, not yet
high, but gusty and unsteady to the point; the rain, on the other
hand, had ceased.&nbsp; Short as was the interval, the sea
already ran vastly higher than when I had stood there last;
already it had begun to break over some of the outward reefs, and
already it moaned aloud in the sea-caves of Aros.&nbsp; I looked,
at first, in vain for the schooner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There she is,&rsquo; I said at last.&nbsp; But her new
position, and the course she was now lying, puzzled me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They cannot mean to beat to sea,&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what they mean,&rsquo; said my uncle, with
something like joy; and just then the schooner went about and
stood upon another tack, which put the question beyond the reach
of doubt.&nbsp; These strangers, seeing a gale on hand, had
thought first of sea-room.&nbsp; With the wind that threatened,
in these reef-sown waters and contending against so violent a
stream of tide, their course was certain death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;they are all
lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; returned my uncle,
&lsquo;a&rsquo;&mdash;a&rsquo; lost.&nbsp; They hadnae a chance
but to rin for Kyle Dona.&nbsp; The gate they&rsquo;re gaun the
noo, they couldnae win through an the muckle deil were there to
pilot them.&nbsp; Eh, man,&rsquo; he continued, touching me on
the sleeve, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a braw nicht for a shipwreck!&nbsp;
Twa in ae twalmonth!&nbsp; Eh, but the Merry Men&rsquo;ll dance
bonny!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him, and it was then that I began to fancy him no
longer in his right mind.&nbsp; He was peering up to me, as if
for sympathy, a timid joy in his eyes.&nbsp; All that had passed
between us was already forgotten in the prospect of this fresh
disaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were not too late,&rsquo; I cried with
indignation, &lsquo;I would take the coble and go out to warn
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Na, na,&rsquo; he protested, &lsquo;ye maunnae
interfere; ye maunnae meddle wi&rsquo; the like o&rsquo;
that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s His&rsquo;&mdash;doffing his
bonnet&mdash;&lsquo;His wull.&nbsp; And, eh, man! but it&rsquo;s
a braw nicht for&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something like fear began to creep into my soul and, reminding
him that I had not yet dined, I proposed we should return to the
house.&nbsp; But no; nothing would tear him from his place of
outlook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I maun see the hail thing, man, Cherlie,&rsquo; he
explained&mdash;and then as the schooner went about a second
time, &lsquo;Eh, but they han&rsquo;le her bonny!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The <i>Christ-Anna</i> was naething to
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Already the men on board the schooner must have begun to
realise some part, but not yet the twentieth, of the dangers that
environed their doomed ship.&nbsp; At every lull of the
capricious wind they must have seen how fast the current swept
them back.&nbsp; Each tack was made shorter, as they saw how
little it prevailed.&nbsp; Every moment the rising swell began to
boom and foam upon another sunken reef; and ever and again a
breaker would fall in sounding ruin under the very bows of her,
and the brown reef and streaming tangle appear in the hollow of
the wave.&nbsp; I tell you, they had to stand to their tackle:
there was no idle men aboard that ship, God knows.&nbsp; It was
upon the progress of a scene so horrible to any human-hearted man
that my misguided uncle now pored and gloated like a
connoisseur.&nbsp; As I turned to go down the hill, he was lying
on his belly on the summit, with his hands stretched forth and
clutching in the heather.&nbsp; He seemed rejuvenated, mind and
body.</p>
<p>When I got back to the house already dismally affected, I was
still more sadly downcast at the sight of Mary.&nbsp; She had her
sleeves rolled up over her strong arms, and was quietly making
bread.&nbsp; I got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat
it in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are ye wearied, lad?&rsquo; she asked after a
while.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not so much wearied, Mary,&rsquo; I replied,
getting on my feet, &lsquo;as I am weary of delay, and perhaps of
Aros too.&nbsp; You know me well enough to judge me fairly, say
what I like.&nbsp; Well, Mary, you may be sure of this: you had
better be anywhere but here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure of one thing,&rsquo; she returned:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be where my duty is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget, you have a duty to yourself,&rsquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, man?&rsquo; she replied, pounding at the dough;
&lsquo;will you have found that in the Bible, now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I said solemnly, &lsquo;you must not laugh
at me just now.&nbsp; God knows I am in no heart for
laughing.&nbsp; If we could get your father with us, it would be
best; but with him or without him, I want you far away from here,
my girl; for your own sake, and for mine, ay, and for your
father&rsquo;s too, I want you far&mdash;far away from
here.&nbsp; I came with other thoughts; I came here as a man
comes home; now it is all changed, and I have no desire nor hope
but to flee&mdash;for that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;flee, like a
bird out of the fowler&rsquo;s snare, from this accursed
island.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had stopped her work by this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you think, now,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;do you
think, now, I have neither eyes nor ears?&nbsp; Do ye think I
havenae broken my heart to have these braws (as he calls them,
God forgive him!) thrown into the sea?&nbsp; Do ye think I have
lived with him, day in, day out, and not seen what you saw in an
hour or two?&nbsp; No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I know
there&rsquo;s wrong in it; what wrong, I neither know nor want to
know.&nbsp; There was never an ill thing made better by meddling,
that I could hear of.&nbsp; But, my lad, you must never ask me to
leave my father.&nbsp; While the breath is in his body,
I&rsquo;ll be with him.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s not long for here,
either: that I can tell you, Charlie&mdash;he&rsquo;s not long
for here.&nbsp; The mark is on his brow; and better
so&mdash;maybe better so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was a while silent, not knowing what to say; and when I
roused my head at last to speak, she got before me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlie,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s right for
me, neednae be right for you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s sin upon this
house and trouble; you are a stranger; take your things upon your
back and go your ways to better places and to better folk, and if
you were ever minded to come back, though it were twenty years
syne, you would find me aye waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary Ellen,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I asked you to be my
wife, and you said as good as yes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s done for
good.&nbsp; Wherever you are, I am; as I shall answer to my
God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I said the words, the wind suddenly burst out raving, and
then seemed to stand still and shudder round the house of
Aros.&nbsp; It was the first squall, or prologue, of the coming
tempest, and as we started and looked about us, we found that a
gloom, like the approach of evening, had settled round the
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God pity all poor folks at sea!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see no more of my father till the
morrow&rsquo;s morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then she told me, as we sat by the fire and hearkened to
the rising gusts, of how this change had fallen upon my
uncle.&nbsp; All last winter he had been dark and fitful in his
mind.&nbsp; Whenever the Roost ran high, or, as Mary said,
whenever the Merry Men were dancing, he would lie out for hours
together on the Head, if it were at night, or on the top of Aros
by day, watching the tumult of the sea, and sweeping the horizon
for a sail.&nbsp; After February the tenth, when the
wealth-bringing wreck was cast ashore at Sandag, he had been at
first unnaturally gay, and his excitement had never fallen in
degree, but only changed in kind from dark to darker.&nbsp; He
neglected his work, and kept Rorie idle.&nbsp; They two would
speak together by the hour at the gable end, in guarded tones and
with an air of secrecy and almost of guilt; and if she questioned
either, as at first she sometimes did, her inquiries were put
aside with confusion.&nbsp; Since Rorie had first remarked the
fish that hung about the ferry, his master had never set foot but
once upon the mainland of the Ross.&nbsp; That once&mdash;it was
in the height of the springs&mdash;he had passed dryshod while
the tide was out; but, having lingered overlong on the far side,
found himself cut off from Aros by the returning waters.&nbsp; It
was with a shriek of agony that he had leaped across the gut, and
he had reached home thereafter in a fever-fit of fear.&nbsp; A
fear of the sea, a constant haunting thought of the sea, appeared
in his talk and devotions, and even in his looks when he was
silent.</p>
<p>Rorie alone came in to supper; but a little later my uncle
appeared, took a bottle under his arm, put some bread in his
pocket, and set forth again to his outlook, followed this time by
Rorie.&nbsp; I heard that the schooner was losing ground, but the
crew were still fighting every inch with hopeless ingenuity and
course; and the news filled my mind with blackness.</p>
<p>A little after sundown the full fury of the gale broke forth,
such a gale as I have never seen in summer, nor, seeing how
swiftly it had come, even in winter.&nbsp; Mary and I sat in
silence, the house quaking overhead, the tempest howling without,
the fire between us sputtering with raindrops.&nbsp; Our thoughts
were far away with the poor fellows on the schooner, or my not
less unhappy uncle, houseless on the promontory; and yet ever and
again we were startled back to ourselves, when the wind would
rise and strike the gable like a solid body, or suddenly fall and
draw away, so that the fire leaped into flame and our hearts
bounded in our sides.&nbsp; Now the storm in its might would
seize and shake the four corners of the roof, roaring like
Leviathan in anger.&nbsp; Anon, in a lull, cold eddies of tempest
moved shudderingly in the room, lifting the hair upon our heads
and passing between us as we sat.&nbsp; And again the wind would
break forth in a chorus of melancholy sounds, hooting low in the
chimney, wailing with flutelike softness round the house.</p>
<p>It was perhaps eight o&rsquo;clock when Rorie came in and
pulled me mysteriously to the door.&nbsp; My uncle, it appeared,
had frightened even his constant comrade; and Rorie, uneasy at
his extravagance, prayed me to come out and share the
watch.&nbsp; I hastened to do as I was asked; the more readily
as, what with fear and horror, and the electrical tension of the
night, I was myself restless and disposed for action.&nbsp; I
told Mary to be under no alarm, for I should be a safeguard on
her father; and wrapping myself warmly in a plaid, I followed
Rorie into the open air.</p>
<p>The night, though we were so little past midsummer, was as
dark as January.&nbsp; Intervals of a groping twilight alternated
with spells of utter blackness; and it was impossible to trace
the reason of these changes in the flying horror of the
sky.&nbsp; The wind blew the breath out of a man&rsquo;s
nostrils; all heaven seemed to thunder overhead like one huge
sail; and when there fell a momentary lull on Aros, we could hear
the gusts dismally sweeping in the distance.&nbsp; Over all the
lowlands of the Ross, the wind must have blown as fierce as on
the open sea; and God only knows the uproar that was raging
around the head of Ben Kyaw.&nbsp; Sheets of mingled spray and
rain were driven in our faces.&nbsp; All round the isle of Aros
the surf, with an incessant, hammering thunder, beat upon the
reefs and beaches.&nbsp; Now louder in one place, now lower in
another, like the combinations of orchestral music, the constant
mass of sound was hardly varied for a moment.&nbsp; And loud
above all this hurly-burly I could hear the changeful voices of
the Roost and the intermittent roaring of the Merry Men.&nbsp; At
that hour, there flashed into my mind the reason of the name that
they were called.&nbsp; For the noise of them seemed almost
mirthful, as it out-topped the other noises of the night; or if
not mirthful, yet instinct with a portentous joviality.&nbsp;
Nay, and it seemed even human.&nbsp; As when savage men have
drunk away their reason, and, discarding speech, bawl together in
their madness by the hour; so, to my ears, these deadly breakers
shouted by Aros in the night.</p>
<p>Arm in arm, and staggering against the wind, Rorie and I won
every yard of ground with conscious effort.&nbsp; We slipped on
the wet sod, we fell together sprawling on the rocks.&nbsp;
Bruised, drenched, beaten, and breathless, it must have taken us
near half an hour to get from the house down to the Head that
overlooks the Roost.&nbsp; There, it seemed, was my uncle&rsquo;s
favourite observatory.&nbsp; Right in the face of it, where the
cliff is highest and most sheer, a hump of earth, like a parapet,
makes a place of shelter from the common winds, where a man may
sit in quiet and see the tide and the mad billows contending at
his feet.&nbsp; As he might look down from the window of a house
upon some street disturbance, so, from this post, he looks down
upon the tumbling of the Merry Men.&nbsp; On such a night, of
course, he peers upon a world of blackness, where the waters
wheel and boil, where the waves joust together with the noise of
an explosion, and the foam towers and vanishes in the twinkling
of an eye.&nbsp; Never before had I seen the Merry Men thus
violent.&nbsp; The fury, height, and transiency of their
spoutings was a thing to be seen and not recounted.&nbsp; High
over our heads on the cliff rose their white columns in the
darkness; and the same instant, like phantoms, they were
gone.&nbsp; Sometimes three at a time would thus aspire and
vanish; sometimes a gust took them, and the spray would fall
about us, heavy as a wave.&nbsp; And yet the spectacle was rather
maddening in its levity than impressive by its force.&nbsp;
Thought was beaten down by the confounding uproar&mdash;a gleeful
vacancy possessed the brains of men, a state akin to madness; and
I found myself at times following the dance of the Merry Men as
it were a tune upon a jigging instrument.</p>
<p>I first caught sight of my uncle when we were still some yards
away in one of the flying glimpses of twilight that chequered the
pitch darkness of the night.&nbsp; He was standing up behind the
parapet, his head thrown back and the bottle to his mouth.&nbsp;
As he put it down, he saw and recognised us with a toss of one
hand fleeringly above his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has he been drinking?&rsquo; shouted I to Rorie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will aye be drunk when the wind blaws,&rsquo;
returned Rorie in the same high key, and it was all that I could
do to hear him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then&mdash;was he so&mdash;in February?&rsquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>Rorie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ay&rsquo; was a cause of joy to me.&nbsp;
The murder, then, had not sprung in cold blood from calculation;
it was an act of madness no more to be condemned than to be
pardoned.&nbsp; My uncle was a dangerous madman, if you will, but
he was not cruel and base as I had feared.&nbsp; Yet what a scene
for a carouse, what an incredible vice, was this that the poor
man had chosen!&nbsp; I have always thought drunkenness a wild
and almost fearful pleasure, rather demoniacal than human; but
drunkenness, out here in the roaring blackness, on the edge of a
cliff above that hell of waters, the man&rsquo;s head spinning
like the Roost, his foot tottering on the edge of death, his ear
watching for the signs of ship-wreck, surely that, if it were
credible in any one, was morally impossible in a man like my
uncle, whose mind was set upon a damnatory creed and haunted by
the darkest superstitions.&nbsp; Yet so it was; and, as we
reached the bight of shelter and could breathe again, I saw the
man&rsquo;s eyes shining in the night with an unholy glimmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, Charlie, man, it&rsquo;s grand!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;See to them!&rsquo; he continued, dragging me
to the edge of the abyss from whence arose that deafening clamour
and those clouds of spray; &lsquo;see to them dancin&rsquo;,
man!&nbsp; Is that no wicked?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pronounced the word with gusto, and I thought it suited
with the scene.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re yowlin&rsquo; for thon schooner,&rsquo;
he went on, his thin, insane voice clearly audible in the shelter
of the bank, &lsquo;an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; aye
nearer, aye nearer, aye nearer an&rsquo; nearer an&rsquo; nearer;
an&rsquo; they ken&rsquo;t, the folk kens it, they ken wool
it&rsquo;s by wi&rsquo; them.&nbsp; Charlie, lad, they&rsquo;re
a&rsquo; drunk in yon schooner, a&rsquo; dozened wi&rsquo;
drink.&nbsp; They were a&rsquo; drunk in the <i>Christ-Anna</i>,
at the hinder end.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nane could droon at sea
wantin&rsquo; the brandy.&nbsp; Hoot awa, what do you ken?&rsquo;
with a sudden blast of anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell ye, it cannae
be; they droon withoot it.&nbsp; Ha&rsquo;e,&rsquo; holding out
the bottle, &lsquo;tak&rsquo; a sowp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was about to refuse, but Rorie touched me as if in warning;
and indeed I had already thought better of the movement.&nbsp; I
took the bottle, therefore, and not only drank freely myself, but
contrived to spill even more as I was doing so.&nbsp; It was pure
spirit, and almost strangled me to swallow.&nbsp; My kinsman did
not observe the loss, but, once more throwing back his head,
drained the remainder to the dregs.&nbsp; Then, with a loud
laugh, he cast the bottle forth among the Merry Men, who seemed
to leap up, shouting to receive it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha&rsquo;e, bairns!&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s your han&rsquo;sel.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll get
bonnier nor that, or morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, out in the black night before us, and not two
hundred yards away, we heard, at a moment when the wind was
silent, the clear note of a human voice.&nbsp; Instantly the wind
swept howling down upon the Head, and the Roost bellowed, and
churned, and danced with a new fury.&nbsp; But we had heard the
sound, and we knew, with agony, that this was the doomed ship now
close on ruin, and that what we had heard was the voice of her
master issuing his last command.&nbsp; Crouching together on the
edge, we waited, straining every sense, for the inevitable
end.&nbsp; It was long, however, and to us it seemed like ages,
ere the schooner suddenly appeared for one brief instant,
relieved against a tower of glimmering foam.&nbsp; I still see
her reefed mainsail flapping loose, as the boom fell heavily
across the deck; I still see the black outline of the hull, and
still think I can distinguish the figure of a man stretched upon
the tiller.&nbsp; Yet the whole sight we had of her passed
swifter than lightning; the very wave that disclosed her fell
burying her for ever; the mingled cry of many voices at the point
of death rose and was quenched in the roaring of the Merry
Men.&nbsp; And with that the tragedy was at an end.&nbsp; The
strong ship, with all her gear, and the lamp perhaps still
burning in the cabin, the lives of so many men, precious surely
to others, dear, at least, as heaven to themselves, had all, in
that one moment, gone down into the surging waters.&nbsp; They
were gone like a dream.&nbsp; And the wind still ran and shouted,
and the senseless waters in the Roost still leaped and tumbled as
before.</p>
<p>How long we lay there together, we three, speechless and
motionless, is more than I can tell, but it must have been for
long.&nbsp; At length, one by one, and almost mechanically, we
crawled back into the shelter of the bank.&nbsp; As I lay against
the parapet, wholly wretched and not entirely master of my mind,
I could hear my kinsman maundering to himself in an altered and
melancholy mood.&nbsp; Now he would repeat to himself with
maudlin iteration, &lsquo;Sic a fecht as they had&mdash;sic a
sair fecht as they had, puir lads, puir lads!&rsquo; and anon he
would bewail that &lsquo;a&rsquo; the gear was as gude&rsquo;s
tint,&rsquo; because the ship had gone down among the Merry Men
instead of stranding on the shore; and throughout, the
name&mdash;the <i>Christ-Anna</i>&mdash;would come and go in his
divagations, pronounced with shuddering awe.&nbsp; The storm all
this time was rapidly abating.&nbsp; In half an hour the wind had
fallen to a breeze, and the change was accompanied or caused by a
heavy, cold, and plumping rain.&nbsp; I must then have fallen
asleep, and when I came to myself, drenched, stiff, and
unrefreshed, day had already broken, grey, wet, discomfortable
day; the wind blew in faint and shifting capfuls, the tide was
out, the Roost was at its lowest, and only the strong beating
surf round all the coasts of Aros remained to witness of the
furies of the night.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; A MAN OUT OF THE SEA.</h3>
<p>Rorie set out for the house in search of warmth and breakfast;
but my uncle was bent upon examining the shores of Aros, and I
felt it a part of duty to accompany him throughout.&nbsp; He was
now docile and quiet, but tremulous and weak in mind and body;
and it was with the eagerness of a child that he pursued his
exploration.&nbsp; He climbed far down upon the rocks; on the
beaches, he pursued the retreating breakers.&nbsp; The merest
broken plank or rag of cordage was a treasure in his eyes to be
secured at the peril of his life.&nbsp; To see him, with weak and
stumbling footsteps, expose himself to the pursuit of the surf,
or the snares and pitfalls of the weedy rock, kept me in a
perpetual terror.&nbsp; My arm was ready to support him, my hand
clutched him by the skirt, I helped him to draw his pitiful
discoveries beyond the reach of the returning wave; a nurse
accompanying a child of seven would have had no different
experience.</p>
<p>Yet, weakened as he was by the reaction from his madness of
the night before, the passions that smouldered in his nature were
those of a strong man.&nbsp; His terror of the sea, although
conquered for the moment, was still undiminished; had the sea
been a lake of living flames, he could not have shrunk more
panically from its touch; and once, when his foot slipped and he
plunged to the midleg into a pool of water, the shriek that came
up out of his soul was like the cry of death.&nbsp; He sat still
for a while, panting like a dog, after that; but his desire for
the spoils of shipwreck triumphed once more over his fears; once
more he tottered among the curded foam; once more he crawled upon
the rocks among the bursting bubbles; once more his whole heart
seemed to be set on driftwood, fit, if it was fit for anything,
to throw upon the fire.&nbsp; Pleased as he was with what he
found, he still incessantly grumbled at his ill-fortune.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aros,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is no a place for wrecks
ava&rsquo;&mdash;no ava&rsquo;.&nbsp; A&rsquo; the years
I&rsquo;ve dwalt here, this ane maks the second; and the best
o&rsquo; the gear clean tint!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle,&rsquo; said I, for we were now on a stretch of
open sand, where there was nothing to divert his mind, &lsquo;I
saw you last night, as I never thought to see you&mdash;you were
drunk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Na, na,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;no as bad as that.&nbsp;
I had been drinking, though.&nbsp; And to tell ye the God&rsquo;s
truth, it&rsquo;s a thing I cannae mend.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nae
soberer man than me in my ordnar; but when I hear the wind blaw
in my lug, it&rsquo;s my belief that I gang gyte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a religious man,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;and
this is sin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ou,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;if it wasnae sin, I
dinnae ken that I would care for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Ye see, man,
it&rsquo;s defiance.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a sair spang o&rsquo;
the auld sin o&rsquo; the warld in you sea; it&rsquo;s an
unchristian business at the best o&rsquo;t; an&rsquo; whiles when
it gets up, an&rsquo; the wind skreights&mdash;the wind an&rsquo;
her are a kind of sib, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
thae Merry Men, the daft callants, blawin&rsquo; and
lauchin&rsquo;, and puir souls in the deid thraws warstlin&rsquo;
the leelang nicht wi&rsquo; their bit ships&mdash;weel, it comes
ower me like a glamour.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a deil, I
ken&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I think naething o&rsquo; the puir sailor
lads; I&rsquo;m wi&rsquo; the sea, I&rsquo;m just like ane
o&rsquo; her ain Merry Men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I thought I should touch him in a joint of his harness.&nbsp;
I turned me towards the sea; the surf was running gaily, wave
after wave, with their manes blowing behind them, riding one
after another up the beach, towering, curving, falling one upon
another on the trampled sand.&nbsp; Without, the salt air, the
scared gulls, the widespread army of the sea-chargers, neighing
to each other, as they gathered together to the assault of Aros;
and close before us, that line on the flat sands that, with all
their number and their fury, they might never pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus far shalt thou go,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and no
farther.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then I quoted as solemnly as I was able
a verse that I had often before fitted to the chorus of the
breakers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But yet the Lord that is on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is more of might by far,<br />
Than noise of many waters is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As great sea billows are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said my kinsinan, &lsquo;at the hinder end,
the Lord will triumph; I dinnae misdoobt that.&nbsp; But here on
earth, even silly men-folk daur Him to His face.&nbsp; It is nae
wise; I am nae sayin&rsquo; that it&rsquo;s wise; but it&rsquo;s
the pride of the eye, and it&rsquo;s the lust o&rsquo; life,
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the wale o&rsquo; pleesures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said no more, for we had now begun to cross a neck of land
that lay between us and Sandag; and I withheld my last appeal to
the man&rsquo;s better reason till we should stand upon the spot
associated with his crime.&nbsp; Nor did he pursue the subject;
but he walked beside me with a firmer step.&nbsp; The call that I
had made upon his mind acted like a stimulant, and I could see
that he had forgotten his search for worthless jetsam, in a
profound, gloomy, and yet stirring train of thought.&nbsp; In
three or four minutes we had topped the brae and begun to go down
upon Sandag.&nbsp; The wreck had been roughly handled by the sea;
the stem had been spun round and dragged a little lower down; and
perhaps the stern had been forced a little higher, for the two
parts now lay entirely separate on the beach.&nbsp; When we came
to the grave I stopped, uncovered my head in the thick rain, and,
looking my kinsman in the face, addressed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;was in God&rsquo;s
providence suffered to escape from mortal dangers; he was poor,
he was naked, he was wet, he was weary, he was a stranger; he had
every claim upon the bowels of your compassion; it may be that he
was the salt of the earth, holy, helpful, and kind; it may be he
was a man laden with iniquities to whom death was the beginning
of torment.&nbsp; I ask you in the sight of heaven: Gordon
Darnaway, where is the man for whom Christ died?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He started visibly at the last words; but there came no
answer, and his face expressed no feeling but a vague alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were my father&rsquo;s brother,&rsquo; I continued;
&lsquo;You, have taught me to count your house as if it were my
father&rsquo;s house; and we are both sinful men walking before
the Lord among the sins and dangers of this life.&nbsp; It is by
our evil that God leads us into good; we sin, I dare not say by
His temptation, but I must say with His consent; and to any but
the brutish man his sins are the beginning of wisdom.&nbsp; God
has warned you by this crime; He warns you still by the bloody
grave between our feet; and if there shall follow no repentance,
no improvement, no return to Him, what can we look for but the
following of some memorable judgment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as I spoke the words, the eyes of my uncle wandered from
my face.&nbsp; A change fell upon his looks that cannot be
described; his features seemed to dwindle in size, the colour
faded from his cheeks, one hand rose waveringly and pointed over
my shoulder into the distance, and the oft-repeated name fell
once more from his lips: &lsquo;The
<i>Christ-Anna</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I turned; and if I was not appalled to the same degree, as I
return thanks to Heaven that I had not the cause, I was still
startled by the sight that met my eyes.&nbsp; The form of a man
stood upright on the cabin-hutch of the wrecked ship; his back
was towards us; he appeared to be scanning the offing with shaded
eyes, and his figure was relieved to its full height, which was
plainly very great, against the sea and sky.&nbsp; I have said a
thousand times that I am not superstitious; but at that moment,
with my mind running upon death and sin, the unexplained
appearance of a stranger on that sea-girt, solitary island filled
me with a surprise that bordered close on terror.&nbsp; It seemed
scarce possible that any human soul should have come ashore alive
in such a sea as had rated last night along the coasts of Aros;
and the only vessel within miles had gone down before our eyes
among the Merry Men.&nbsp; I was assailed with doubts that made
suspense unbearable, and, to put the matter to the touch at once,
stepped forward and hailed the figure like a ship.</p>
<p>He turned about, and I thought he started to behold us.&nbsp;
At this my courage instantly revived, and I called and signed to
him to draw near, and he, on his part, dropped immediately to the
sands, and began slowly to approach, with many stops and
hesitations.&nbsp; At each repeated mark of the man&rsquo;s
uneasiness I grew the more confident myself; and I advanced
another step, encouraging him as I did so with my head and
hand.&nbsp; It was plain the castaway had heard indifferent
accounts of our island hospitality; and indeed, about this time,
the people farther north had a sorry reputation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the man is black!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And just at that moment, in a voice that I could scarce have
recognised, my kinsman began swearing and praying in a mingled
stream.&nbsp; I looked at him; he had fallen on his knees, his
face was agonised; at each step of the castaway&rsquo;s the pitch
of his voice rose, the volubility of his utterance and the
fervour of his language redoubled.&nbsp; I call it prayer, for it
was addressed to God; but surely no such ranting incongruities
were ever before addressed to the Creator by a creature: surely
if prayer can be a sin, this mad harangue was sinful.&nbsp; I ran
to my kinsman, I seized him by the shoulders, I dragged him to
his feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, man,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;respect your God in
words, if not in action.&nbsp; Here, on the very scene of your
transgressions, He sends you an occasion of atonement.&nbsp;
Forward and embrace it; welcome like a father yon creature who
comes trembling to your mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that, I tried to force him towards the black; but he
felled me to the ground, burst from my grasp, leaving the
shoulder of his jacket, and fled up the hillside towards the top
of Aros like a deer.&nbsp; I staggered to my feet again, bruised
and somewhat stunned; the negro had paused in surprise, perhaps
in terror, some halfway between me and the wreck; my uncle was
already far away, bounding from rock to rock; and I thus found
myself torn for a time between two duties.&nbsp; But I judged,
and I pray Heaven that I judged rightly, in favour of the poor
wretch upon the sands; his misfortune was at least not plainly of
his own creation; it was one, besides, that I could certainly
relieve; and I had begun by that time to regard my uncle as an
incurable and dismal lunatic.&nbsp; I advanced accordingly
towards the black, who now awaited my approach with folded arms,
like one prepared for either destiny.&nbsp; As I came nearer, he
reached forth his hand with a great gesture, such as I had seen
from the pulpit, and spoke to me in something of a pulpit voice,
but not a word was comprehensible.&nbsp; I tried him first in
English, then in Gaelic, both in vain; so that it was clear we
must rely upon the tongue of looks and gestures.&nbsp; Thereupon
I signed to him to follow me, which he did readily and with a
grave obeisance like a fallen king; all the while there had come
no shade of alteration in his face, neither of anxiety while he
was still waiting, nor of relief now that he was reassured; if he
were a slave, as I supposed, I could not but judge he must have
fallen from some high place in his own country, and fallen as he
was, I could not but admire his bearing.&nbsp; As we passed the
grave, I paused and raised my hands and eyes to heaven in token
of respect and sorrow for the dead; and he, as if in answer,
bowed low and spread his hands abroad; it was a strange motion,
but done like a thing of common custom; and I supposed it was
ceremonial in the land from which he came.&nbsp; At the same time
he pointed to my uncle, whom we could just see perched upon a
knoll, and touched his head to indicate that he was mad.</p>
<p>We took the long way round the shore, for I feared to excite
my uncle if we struck across the island; and as we walked, I had
time enough to mature the little dramatic exhibition by which I
hoped to satisfy my doubts.&nbsp; Accordingly, pausing on a rock,
I proceeded to imitate before the negro the action of the man
whom I had seen the day before taking bearings with the compass
at Sandag.&nbsp; He understood me at once, and, taking the
imitation out of my hands, showed me where the boat was, pointed
out seaward as if to indicate the position of the schooner, and
then down along the edge of the rock with the words
&lsquo;Espirito Santo,&rsquo; strangely pronounced, but clear
enough for recognition.&nbsp; I had thus been right in my
conjecture; the pretended historical inquiry had been but a cloak
for treasure-hunting; the man who had played on Dr. Robertson was
the same as the foreigner who visited Grisapol in spring, and
now, with many others, lay dead under the Roost of Aros: there
had their greed brought them, there should their bones be tossed
for evermore.&nbsp; In the meantime the black continued his
imitation of the scene, now looking up skyward as though watching
the approach of the storm now, in the character of a seaman,
waving the rest to come aboard; now as an officer, running along
the rock and entering the boat; and anon bending over imaginary
oars with the air of a hurried boatman; but all with the same
solemnity of manner, so that I was never even moved to
smile.&nbsp; Lastly, he indicated to me, by a pantomime not to be
described in words, how he himself had gone up to examine the
stranded wreck, and, to his grief and indignation, had been
deserted by his comrades; and thereupon folded his arms once
more, and stooped his head, like one accepting fate.</p>
<p>The mystery of his presence being thus solved for me, I
explained to him by means of a sketch the fate of the vessel and
of all aboard her.&nbsp; He showed no surprise nor sorrow, and,
with a sudden lifting of his open hand, seemed to dismiss his
former friends or masters (whichever they had been) into
God&rsquo;s pleasure.&nbsp; Respect came upon me and grew
stronger, the more I observed him; I saw he had a powerful mind
and a sober and severe character, such as I loved to commune
with; and before we reached the house of Aros I had almost
forgotten, and wholly forgiven him, his uncanny colour.</p>
<p>To Mary I told all that had passed without suppression, though
I own my heart failed me; but I did wrong to doubt her sense of
justice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did the right,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s will be done.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she set out
meat for us at once.</p>
<p>As soon as I was satisfied, I bade Rorie keep an eye upon the
castaway, who was still eating, and set forth again myself to
find my uncle.&nbsp; I had not gone far before I saw him sitting
in the same place, upon the very topmost knoll, and seemingly in
the same attitude as when I had last observed him.&nbsp; From
that point, as I have said, the most of Aros and the neighbouring
Ross would be spread below him like a map; and it was plain that
he kept a bright look-out in all directions, for my head had
scarcely risen above the summit of the first ascent before he had
leaped to his feet and turned as if to face me.&nbsp; I hailed
him at once, as well as I was able, in the same tones and words
as I had often used before, when I had come to summon him to
dinner.&nbsp; He made not so much as a movement in reply.&nbsp; I
passed on a little farther, and again tried parley, with the same
result.&nbsp; But when I began a second time to advance, his
insane fears blazed up again, and still in dead silence, but with
incredible speed, he began to flee from before me along the rocky
summit of the hill.&nbsp; An hour before, he had been dead weary,
and I had been comparatively active.&nbsp; But now his strength
was recruited by the fervour of insanity, and it would have been
vain for me to dream of pursuit.&nbsp; Nay, the very attempt, I
thought, might have inflamed his terrors, and thus increased the
miseries of our position.&nbsp; And I had nothing left but to
turn homeward and make my sad report to Mary.</p>
<p>She heard it, as she had heard the first, with a concerned
composure, and, bidding me lie down and take that rest of which I
stood so much in need, set forth herself in quest of her
misguided father.&nbsp; At that age it would have been a strange
thing that put me from either meat or sleep; I slept long and
deep; and it was already long past noon before I awoke and came
downstairs into the kitchen.&nbsp; Mary, Rorie, and the black
castaway were seated about the fire in silence; and I could see
that Mary had been weeping.&nbsp; There was cause enough, as I
soon learned, for tears.&nbsp; First she, and then Rorie, had
been forth to seek my uncle; each in turn had found him perched
upon the hill-top, and from each in turn he had silently and
swiftly fled.&nbsp; Rorie had tried to chase him, but in vain;
madness lent a new vigour to his bounds; he sprang from rock to
rock over the widest gullies; he scoured like the wind along the
hill-tops; he doubled and twisted like a hare before the dogs;
and Rorie at length gave in; and the last that he saw, my uncle
was seated as before upon the crest of Aros.&nbsp; Even during
the hottest excitement of the chase, even when the fleet-footed
servant had come, for a moment, very near to capture him, the
poor lunatic had uttered not a sound.&nbsp; He fled, and he was
silent, like a beast; and this silence had terrified his
pursuer.</p>
<p>There was something heart-breaking in the situation.&nbsp; How
to capture the madman, how to feed him in the meanwhile, and what
to do with him when he was captured, were the three difficulties
that we had to solve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The black,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is the cause of this
attack.&nbsp; It may even be his presence in the house that keeps
my uncle on the hill.&nbsp; We have done the fair thing; he has
been fed and warmed under this roof; now I propose that Rorie put
him across the bay in the coble, and take him through the Ross as
far as Grisapol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this proposal Mary heartily concurred; and bidding the
black follow us, we all three descended to the pier.&nbsp;
Certainly, Heaven&rsquo;s will was declared against Gordon
Darnaway; a thing had happened, never paralleled before in Aros;
during the storm, the coble had broken loose, and, striking on
the rough splinters of the pier, now lay in four feet of water
with one side stove in.&nbsp; Three days of work at least would
be required to make her float.&nbsp; But I was not to be
beaten.&nbsp; I led the whole party round to where the gut was
narrowest, swam to the other side, and called to the black to
follow me.&nbsp; He signed, with the same clearness and quiet as
before, that he knew not the art; and there was truth apparent in
his signals, it would have occurred to none of us to doubt his
truth; and that hope being over, we must all go back even as we
came to the house of Aros, the negro walking in our midst without
embarrassment.</p>
<p>All we could do that day was to make one more attempt to
communicate with the unhappy madman.&nbsp; Again he was visible
on his perch; again he fled in silence.&nbsp; But food and a
great cloak were at least left for his comfort; the rain,
besides, had cleared away, and the night promised to be even
warm.&nbsp; We might compose ourselves, we thought, until the
morrow; rest was the chief requisite, that we might be
strengthened for unusual exertions; and as none cared to talk, we
separated at an early hour.</p>
<p>I lay long awake, planning a campaign for the morrow.&nbsp; I
was to place the black on the side of Sandag, whence he should
head my uncle towards the house; Rorie in the west, I on the
east, were to complete the cordon, as best we might.&nbsp; It
seemed to me, the more I recalled the configuration of the
island, that it should be possible, though hard, to force him
down upon the low ground along Aros Bay; and once there, even
with the strength of his madness, ultimate escape was hardly to
be feared.&nbsp; It was on his terror of the black that I relied;
for I made sure, however he might run, it would not be in the
direction of the man whom he supposed to have returned from the
dead, and thus one point of the compass at least would be
secure.</p>
<p>When at length I fell asleep, it was to be awakened shortly
after by a dream of wrecks, black men, and submarine adventure;
and I found myself so shaken and fevered that I arose, descended
the stair, and stepped out before the house.&nbsp; Within, Rorie
and the black were asleep together in the kitchen; outside was a
wonderful clear night of stars, with here and there a cloud still
hanging, last stragglers of the tempest.&nbsp; It was near the
top of the flood, and the Merry Men were roaring in the windless
quiet of the night.&nbsp; Never, not even in the height of the
tempest, had I heard their song with greater awe.&nbsp; Now, when
the winds were gathered home, when the deep was dandling itself
back into its summer slumber, and when the stars rained their
gentle light over land and sea, the voice of these tide-breakers
was still raised for havoc.&nbsp; They seemed, indeed, to be a
part of the world&rsquo;s evil and the tragic side of life.&nbsp;
Nor were their meaningless vociferations the only sounds that
broke the silence of the night.&nbsp; For I could hear, now
shrill and thrilling and now almost drowned, the note of a human
voice that accompanied the uproar of the Roost.&nbsp; I knew it
for my kinsman&rsquo;s; and a great fear fell upon me of
God&rsquo;s judgments, and the evil in the world.&nbsp; I went
back again into the darkness of the house as into a place of
shelter, and lay long upon my bed, pondering these mysteries.</p>
<p>It was late when I again woke, and I leaped into my clothes
and hurried to the kitchen.&nbsp; No one was there; Rorie and the
black had both stealthily departed long before; and my heart
stood still at the discovery.&nbsp; I could rely on Rorie&rsquo;s
heart, but I placed no trust in his discretion.&nbsp; If he had
thus set out without a word, he was plainly bent upon some
service to my uncle.&nbsp; But what service could he hope to
render even alone, far less in the company of the man in whom my
uncle found his fears incarnated?&nbsp; Even if I were not
already too late to prevent some deadly mischief, it was plain I
must delay no longer.&nbsp; With the thought I was out of the
house; and often as I have run on the rough sides of Aros, I
never ran as I did that fatal morning.&nbsp; I do not believe I
put twelve minutes to the whole ascent.</p>
<p>My uncle was gone from his perch.&nbsp; The basket had indeed
been torn open and the meat scattered on the turf; but, as we
found afterwards, no mouthful had been tasted; and there was not
another trace of human existence in that wide field of
view.&nbsp; Day had already filled the clear heavens; the sun
already lighted in a rosy bloom upon the crest of Ben Kyaw; but
all below me the rude knolls of Aros and the shield of sea lay
steeped in the clear darkling twilight of the dawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rorie!&rsquo; I cried; and again
&lsquo;Rorie!&rsquo;&nbsp; My voice died in the silence, but
there came no answer back.&nbsp; If there were indeed an
enterprise afoot to catch my uncle, it was plainly not in
fleetness of foot, but in dexterity of stalking, that the hunters
placed their trust.&nbsp; I ran on farther, keeping the higher
spurs, and looking right and left, nor did I pause again till I
was on the mount above Sandag.&nbsp; I could see the wreck, the
uncovered belt of sand, the waves idly beating, the long ledge of
rocks, and on either hand the tumbled knolls, boulders, and
gullies of the island.&nbsp; But still no human thing.</p>
<p>At a stride the sunshine fell on Aros, and the shadows and
colours leaped into being.&nbsp; Not half a moment later, below
me to the west, sheep began to scatter as in a panic.&nbsp; There
came a cry.&nbsp; I saw my uncle running.&nbsp; I saw the black
jump up in hot pursuit; and before I had time to understand,
Rorie also had appeared, calling directions in Gaelic as to a dog
herding sheep.</p>
<p>I took to my heels to interfere, and perhaps I had done better
to have waited where I was, for I was the means of cutting off
the madman&rsquo;s last escape.&nbsp; There was nothing before
him from that moment but the grave, the wreck, and the sea in
Sandag Bay.&nbsp; And yet Heaven knows that what I did was for
the best.</p>
<p>My uncle Gordon saw in what direction, horrible to him, the
chase was driving him.&nbsp; He doubled, darting to the right and
left; but high as the fever ran in his veins, the black was still
the swifter.&nbsp; Turn where he would, he was still forestalled,
still driven toward the scene of his crime.&nbsp; Suddenly he
began to shriek aloud, so that the coast re-echoed; and now both
I and Rorie were calling on the black to stop.&nbsp; But all was
vain, for it was written otherwise.&nbsp; The pursuer still ran,
the chase still sped before him screaming; they avoided the
grave, and skimmed close past the timbers of the wreck; in a
breath they had cleared the sand; and still my kinsman did not
pause, but dashed straight into the surf; and the black, now
almost within reach, still followed swiftly behind him.&nbsp;
Rorie and I both stopped, for the thing was now beyond the hands
of men, and these were the decrees of God that came to pass
before our eyes.&nbsp; There was never a sharper ending.&nbsp; On
that steep beach they were beyond their depth at a bound; neither
could swim; the black rose once for a moment with a throttling
cry; but the current had them, racing seaward; and if ever they
came up again, which God alone can tell, it would be ten minutes
after, at the far end of Aros Roost, where the seabirds hover
fishing.</p>
<h2>WILL O&rsquo; THE MILL.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; THE PLAIN AND THE STARS.</h3>
<p>The Mill here Will lived with his adopted parents stood in a
falling valley between pinewoods and great mountains.&nbsp;
Above, hill after hill, soared upwards until they soared out of
the depth of the hardiest timber, and stood naked against the
sky.&nbsp; Some way up, a long grey village lay like a seam or a
ray of vapour on a wooded hillside; and when the wind was
favourable, the sound of the church bells would drop down, thin
and silvery, to Will.&nbsp; Below, the valley grew ever steeper
and steeper, and at the same time widened out on either hand; and
from an eminence beside the mill it was possible to see its whole
length and away beyond it over a wide plain, where the river
turned and shone, and moved on from city to city on its voyage
towards the sea.&nbsp; It chanced that over this valley there lay
a pass into a neighbouring kingdom; so that, quiet and rural as
it was, the road that ran along beside the river was a high
thoroughfare between two splendid and powerful societies.&nbsp;
All through the summer, travelling-carriages came crawling up, or
went plunging briskly downwards past the mill; and as it happened
that the other side was very much easier of ascent, the path was
not much frequented, except by people going in one direction; and
of all the carriages that Will saw go by, five-sixths were
plunging briskly downwards and only one-sixth crawling up.&nbsp;
Much more was this the case with foot-passengers.&nbsp; All the
light-footed tourists, all the pedlars laden with strange wares,
were tending downward like the river that accompanied their
path.&nbsp; Nor was this all; for when Will was yet a child a
disastrous war arose over a great part of the world.&nbsp; The
newspapers were full of defeats and victories, the earth rang
with cavalry hoofs, and often for days together and for miles
around the coil of battle terrified good people from their
labours in the field.&nbsp; Of all this, nothing was heard for a
long time in the valley; but at last one of the commanders pushed
an army over the pass by forced marches, and for three days horse
and foot, cannon and tumbril, drum and standard, kept pouring
downward past the mill.&nbsp; All day the child stood and watched
them on their passage&mdash;the rhythmical stride, the pale,
unshaven faces tanned about the eyes, the discoloured regimentals
and the tattered flags, filled him with a sense of weariness,
pity, and wonder; and all night long, after he was in bed, he
could hear the cannon pounding and the feet trampling, and the
great armament sweeping onward and downward past the mill.&nbsp;
No one in the valley ever heard the fate of the expedition, for
they lay out of the way of gossip in those troublous times; but
Will saw one thing plainly, that not a man returned.&nbsp;
Whither had they all gone?&nbsp; Whither went all the tourists
and pedlars with strange wares? whither all the brisk barouches
with servants in the dicky? whither the water of the stream, ever
coursing downward and ever renewed from above?&nbsp; Even the
wind blew oftener down the valley, and carried the dead leaves
along with it in the fall.&nbsp; It seemed like a great
conspiracy of things animate and inanimate; they all went
downward, fleetly and gaily downward, and only he, it seemed,
remained behind, like a stock upon the wayside.&nbsp; It
sometimes made him glad when he noticed how the fishes kept their
heads up stream.&nbsp; They, at least, stood faithfully by him,
while all else were posting downward to the unknown world.</p>
<p>One evening he asked the miller where the river went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It goes down the valley,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;and
turns a power of mills&mdash;six score mills, they say, from here
to Unterdeck&mdash;and is none the wearier after all.&nbsp; And
then it goes out into the lowlands, and waters the great corn
country, and runs through a sight of fine cities (so they say)
where kings live all alone in great palaces, with a sentry
walling up and down before the door.&nbsp; And it goes under
bridges with stone men upon them, looking down and smiling so
curious it the water, and living folks leaning their elbows on
the wall and looking over too.&nbsp; And then it goes on and on,
and down through marshes and sands, until at last it falls into
the sea, where the ships are that bring parrots and tobacco from
the Indies.&nbsp; Ay, it has a long trot before it as it goes
singing over our weir, bless its heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is the sea?&rsquo; asked Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sea!&rsquo; cried the miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord
help us all, it is the greatest thing God made!&nbsp; That is
where all the water in the world runs down into a great salt
lake.&nbsp; There it lies, as flat as my hand and as
innocent-like as a child; but they do say when the wind blows it
gets up into water-mountains bigger than any of ours, and
swallows down great ships bigger than our mill, and makes such a
roaring that you can hear it miles away upon the land.&nbsp;
There are great fish in it five times bigger than a bull, and one
old serpent as long as our river and as old as all the world,
with whiskers like a man, and a crown of silver on her
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will thought he had never heard anything like this, and he
kept on asking question after question about the world that lay
away down the river, with all its perils and marvels, until the
old miller became quite interested himself, and at last took him
by the hand and led him to the hilltop that overlooks the valley
and the plain.&nbsp; The sun was near setting, and hung low down
in a cloudless sky.&nbsp; Everything was defined and glorified in
golden light.&nbsp; Will had never seen so great an expanse of
country in his life; he stood and gazed with all his eyes.&nbsp;
He could see the cities, and the woods and fields, and the bright
curves of the river, and far away to where the rim of the plain
trenched along the shining heavens.&nbsp; An over-mastering
emotion seized upon the boy, soul and body; his heart beat so
thickly that he could not breathe; the scene swam before his
eyes; the sun seemed to wheel round and round, and throw off, as
it turned, strange shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of
thought, and were succeeded by others.&nbsp; Will covered his
face with his hands, and burst into a violent fit of tears; and
the poor miller, sadly disappointed and perplexed, saw nothing
better for it than to take him up in his arms and carry him home
in silence.</p>
<p>From that day forward Will was full of new hopes and
longings.&nbsp; Something kept tugging at his heart-strings; the
running water carried his desires along with it as he dreamed
over its fleeting surface; the wind, as it ran over innumerable
tree-tops, hailed him with encouraging words; branches beckoned
downward; the open road, as it shouldered round the angles and
went turning and vanishing fast and faster down the valley,
tortured him with its solicitations.&nbsp; He spent long whiles
on the eminence, looking down the rivershed and abroad on the fat
lowlands, and watched the clouds that travelled forth upon the
sluggish wind and trailed their purple shadows on the plain; or
he would linger by the wayside, and follow the carriages with his
eyes as they rattled downward by the river.&nbsp; It did not
matter what it was; everything that went that way, were it cloud
or carriage, bird or brown water in the stream, he felt his heart
flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing.</p>
<p>We are told by men of science that all the ventures of
mariners on the sea, all that counter-marching of tribes and
races that confounds old history with its dust and rumour, sprang
from nothing more abstruse than the laws of supply and demand,
and a certain natural instinct for cheap rations.&nbsp; To any
one thinking deeply, this will seem a dull and pitiful
explanation.&nbsp; The tribes that came swarming out of the North
and East, if they were indeed pressed onward from behind by
others, were drawn at the same time by the magnetic influence of
the South and West.&nbsp; The fame of other lands had reached
them; the name of the eternal city rang in their ears; they were
not colonists, but pilgrims; they travelled towards wine and gold
and sunshine, but their hearts were set on something
higher.&nbsp; That divine unrest, that old stinging trouble of
humanity that makes all high achievements and all miserable
failure, the same that spread wings with Icarus, the same that
sent Columbus into the desolate Atlantic, inspired and supported
these barbarians on their perilous march.&nbsp; There is one
legend which profoundly represents their spirit, of how a flying
party of these wanderers encountered a very old man shod with
iron.&nbsp; The old man asked them whither they were going; and
they answered with one voice: &lsquo;To the Eternal
City!&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked upon them gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have sought it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;over the most part of the
world.&nbsp; Three such pairs as I now carry on my feet have I
worn out upon this pilgrimage, and now the fourth is growing
slender underneath my steps.&nbsp; And all this while I have not
found the city.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he turned and went his own way
alone, leaving them astonished.</p>
<p>And yet this would scarcely parallel the intensity of
Will&rsquo;s feeling for the plain.&nbsp; If he could only go far
enough out there, he felt as if his eyesight would be purged and
clarified, as if his hearing would grow more delicate, and his
very breath would come and go with luxury.&nbsp; He was
transplanted and withering where he was; he lay in a strange
country and was sick for home.&nbsp; Bit by bit, he pieced
together broken notions of the world below: of the river, ever
moving and growing until it sailed forth into the majestic ocean;
of the cities, full of brisk and beautiful people, playing
fountains, bands of music and marble palaces, and lighted up at
night from end to end with artificial stars of gold; of the great
churches, wise universities, brave armies, and untold money lying
stored in vaults; of the high-flying vice that moved in the
sunshine, and the stealth and swiftness of midnight murder.&nbsp;
I have said he was sick as if for home: the figure halts.&nbsp;
He was like some one lying in twilit, formless preexistence, and
stretching out his hands lovingly towards many-coloured,
many-sounding life.&nbsp; It was no wonder he was unhappy, he
would go and tell the fish: they were made for their life, wished
for no more than worms and running water, and a hole below a
falling bank; but he was differently designed, full of desires
and aspirations, itching at the fingers, lusting with the eyes,
whom the whole variegated world could not satisfy with
aspects.&nbsp; The true life, the true bright sunshine, lay far
out upon the plain.&nbsp; And O! to see this sunlight once before
he died! to move with a jocund spirit in a golden land! to hear
the trained singers and sweet church bells, and see the holiday
gardens!&nbsp; &lsquo;And O fish!&rsquo; he would cry, &lsquo;if
you would only turn your noses down stream, you could swim so
easily into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing over
your head like clouds, and hear the great water-hills making
music over you all day long!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the fish kept
looking patiently in their own direction, until Will hardly knew
whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Hitherto the traffic on the road had passed by Will, like
something seen in a picture: he had perhaps exchanged salutations
with a tourist, or caught sight of an old gentleman in a
travelling cap at a carriage window; but for the most part it had
been a mere symbol, which he contemplated from apart and with
something of a superstitious feeling.&nbsp; A time came at last
when this was to be changed.&nbsp; The miller, who was a greedy
man in his way, and never forewent an opportunity of honest
profit, turned the mill-house into a little wayside inn, and,
several pieces of good fortune falling in opportunely, built
stables and got the position of post master on the road.&nbsp; It
now became Will&rsquo;s duty to wait upon people, as they sat to
break their fasts in the little arbour at the top of the mill
garden; and you may be sure that he kept his ears open, and
learned many new things about the outside world as he brought the
omelette or the wine.&nbsp; Nay, he would often get into
conversation with single guests, and by adroit questions and
polite attention, not only gratify his own curiosity, but win the
goodwill of the travellers.&nbsp; Many complimented the old
couple on their serving-boy; and a professor was eager to take
him away with him, and have him properly educated in the
plain.&nbsp; The miller and his wife were mightily astonished and
even more pleased.&nbsp; They thought it a very good thing that
they should have opened their inn.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see,&rsquo;
the old man would remark, &lsquo;he has a kind of talent for a
publican; he never would have made anything else!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And so life wagged on in the valley, with high satisfaction to
all concerned but Will.&nbsp; Every carriage that left the
inn-door seemed to take a part of him away with it; and when
people jestingly offered him a lift, he could with difficulty
command his emotion.&nbsp; Night after night he would dream that
he was awakened by flustered servants, and that a splendid
equipage waited at the door to carry him down into the plain;
night after night; until the dream, which had seemed all jollity
to him at first, began to take on a colour of gravity, and the
nocturnal summons and waiting equipage occupied a place in his
mind as something to be both feared and hoped for.</p>
<p>One day, when Will was about sixteen, a fat young man arrived
at sunset to pass the night.&nbsp; He was a contented-looking
fellow, with a jolly eye, and carried a knapsack.&nbsp; While
dinner was preparing, he sat in the arbour to read a book; but as
soon as he had begun to observe Will, the book was laid aside; he
was plainly one of those who prefer living people to people made
of ink and paper.&nbsp; Will, on his part, although he had not
been much interested in the stranger at first sight, soon began
to take a great deal of pleasure in his talk, which was full of
good nature and good sense, and at last conceived a great respect
for his character and wisdom.&nbsp; They sat far into the night;
and about two in the morning Will opened his heart to the young
man, and told him how he longed to leave the valley and what
bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain.&nbsp;
The young man whistled, and then broke into a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My young friend,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;you are a
very curious little fellow to be sure, and wish a great many
things which you will never get.&nbsp; Why, you would feel quite
ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these fairy cities
of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense, and keep
breaking their hearts to get up into the mountains.&nbsp; And let
me tell you, those who go down into the plains are a very short
while there before they wish themselves heartily back
again.&nbsp; The air is not so light nor so pure; nor is the sun
any brighter.&nbsp; As for the beautiful men and women, you would
see many of them in rags and many of them deformed with horrible
disorders; and a city is so hard a place for people who are poor
and sensitive that many choose to die by their own
hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must think me very simple,&rsquo; answered
Will.&nbsp; &lsquo;Although I have never been out of this valley,
believe me, I have used my eyes.&nbsp; I know how one thing lives
on another; for instance, how the fish hangs in the eddy to catch
his fellows; and the shepherd, who makes so pretty a picture
carrying home the lamb, is only carrying it home for
dinner.&nbsp; I do not expect to find all things right in your
cities.&nbsp; That is not what troubles me; it might have been
that once upon a time; but although I live here always, I have
asked many questions and learned a great deal in these last
years, and certainly enough to cure me of my old fancies.&nbsp;
But you would not have me die like a dog and not see all that is
to be seen, and do all that a man can do, let it be good or evil?
you would not have me spend all my days between this road here
and the river, and not so much as make a motion to be up and live
my life?&mdash;I would rather die out of hand,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;than linger on as I am doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thousands of people,&rsquo; said the young man,
&lsquo;live and die like you, and are none the less
happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Will, &lsquo;if there are thousands who
would like, why should not one of them have my place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was quite dark; there was a hanging lamp in the arbour
which lit up the table and the faces of the speakers; and along
the arch, the leaves upon the trellis stood out illuminated
against the night sky, a pattern of transparent green upon a
dusky purple.&nbsp; The fat young man rose, and, taking Will by
the arm, led him out under the open heavens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever look at the stars?&rsquo; he asked,
pointing upwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Often and often,&rsquo; answered Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you know what they are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have fancied many things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are worlds like ours,&rsquo; said the young
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some of them less; many of them a million times
greater; and some of the least sparkles that you see are not only
worlds, but whole clusters of worlds turning about each other in
the midst of space.&nbsp; We do not know what there may be in any
of them; perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or the cure
of all our sufferings: and yet we can never reach them; not all
the skill of the craftiest of men can fit out a ship for the
nearest of these our neighbours, nor would the life of the most
aged suffice for such a journey.&nbsp; When a great battle has
been lost or a dear friend is dead, when we are hipped or in high
spirits, there they are unweariedly shining overhead.&nbsp; We
may stand down here, a whole army of us together, and shout until
we break our hearts, and not a whisper reaches them.&nbsp; We may
climb the highest mountain, and we are no nearer them.&nbsp; All
we can do is to stand down here in the garden and take off our
hats; the starshine lights upon our heads, and where mine is a
little bald, I dare say you can see it glisten in the
darkness.&nbsp; The mountain and the mouse.&nbsp; That is like to
be all we shall ever have to do with Arcturus or Aldebaran.&nbsp;
Can you apply a parable?&rsquo; he added, laying his hand upon
Will&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not the same thing as a
reason, but usually vastly more convincing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will hung his head a little, and then raised it once more to
heaven.&nbsp; The stars seemed to expand and emit a sharper
brilliancy; and as he kept turning his eyes higher and higher,
they seemed to increase in multitude under his gaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; he said, turning to the young man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are in a rat-trap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something of that size.&nbsp; Did you ever see a
squirrel turning in a cage? and another squirrel sitting
philosophically over his nuts?&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t ask you
which of them looked more of a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; THE PARSON&rsquo;S MARJORY.</h3>
<p>After some years the old people died, both in one winter, very
carefully tended by their adopted son, and very quietly mourned
when they were gone.&nbsp; People who had heard of his roving
fancies supposed he would hasten to sell the property, and go
down the river to push his fortunes.&nbsp; But there was never
any sign of such in intention on the part of Will.&nbsp; On the
contrary, he had the inn set on a better footing, and hired a
couple of servants to assist him in carrying it on; and there he
settled down, a kind, talkative, inscrutable young man, six feet
three in his stockings, with an iron constitution and a friendly
voice.&nbsp; He soon began to take rank in the district as a bit
of an oddity: it was not much to be wondered at from the first,
for he was always full of notions, and kept calling the plainest
common-sense in question; but what most raised the report upon
him was the odd circumstance of his courtship with the
parson&rsquo;s Marjory.</p>
<p>The parson&rsquo;s Marjory was a lass about nineteen, when
Will would be about thirty; well enough looking, and much better
educated than any other girl in that part of the country, as
became her parentage.&nbsp; She held her head very high, and had
already refused several offers of marriage with a grand air,
which had got her hard names among the neighbours.&nbsp; For all
that she was a good girl, and one that would have made any man
well contented.</p>
<p>Will had never seen much of her; for although the church and
parsonage were only two miles from his own door, he was never
known to go there but on Sundays.&nbsp; It chanced, however, that
the parsonage fell into disrepair, and had to be dismantled; and
the parson and his daughter took lodgings for a month or so, on
very much reduced terms, at Will&rsquo;s inn.&nbsp; Now, what
with the inn, and the mill, and the old miller&rsquo;s savings,
our friend was a man of substance; and besides that, he had a
name for good temper and shrewdness, which make a capital portion
in marriage; and so it was currently gossiped, among their
ill-wishers, that the parson and his daughter had not chosen
their temporary lodging with their eyes shut.&nbsp; Will was
about the last man in the world to be cajoled or frightened into
marriage.&nbsp; You had only to look into his eyes, limpid and
still like pools of water, and yet with a sort of clear light
that seemed to come from within, and you would understand at once
that here was one who knew his own mind, and would stand to it
immovably.&nbsp; Marjory herself was no weakling by her looks,
with strong, steady eyes and a resolute and quiet bearing.&nbsp;
It might be a question whether she was not Will&rsquo;s match in
stedfastness, after all, or which of them would rule the roost in
marriage.&nbsp; But Marjory had never given it a thought, and
accompanied her father with the most unshaken innocence and
unconcern.</p>
<p>The season was still so early that Will&rsquo;s customers were
few and far between; but the lilacs were already flowering, and
the weather was so mild that the party took dinner under the
trellice, with the noise of the river in their ears and the woods
ringing about them with the songs of birds.&nbsp; Will soon began
to take a particular pleasure in these dinners.&nbsp; The parson
was rather a dull companion, with a habit of dozing at table; but
nothing rude or cruel ever fell from his lips.&nbsp; And as for
the parson&rsquo;s daughter, she suited her surroundings with the
best grace imaginable; and whatever she said seemed so pat and
pretty that Will conceived a great idea of her talents.&nbsp; He
could see her face, as she leaned forward, against a background
of rising pinewoods; her eyes shone peaceably; the light lay
around her hair like a kerchief; something that was hardly a
smile rippled her pale cheeks, and Will could not contain himself
from gazing on her in an agreeable dismay.&nbsp; She looked, even
in her quietest moments, so complete in herself, and so quick
with life down to her finger tips and the very skirts of her
dress, that the remainder of created things became no more than a
blot by comparison; and if Will glanced away from her to her
surroundings, the trees looked inanimate and senseless, the
clouds hung in heaven like dead things, and even the mountain
tops were disenchanted.&nbsp; The whole valley could not compare
in looks with this one girl.</p>
<p>Will was always observant in the society of his
fellow-creatures; but his observation became almost painfully
eager in the case of Marjory.&nbsp; He listened to all she
uttered, and read her eyes, at the same time, for the unspoken
commentary.&nbsp; Many kind, simple, and sincere speeches found
an echo in his heart.&nbsp; He became conscious of a soul
beautifully poised upon itself, nothing doubting, nothing
desiring, clothed in peace.&nbsp; It was not possible to separate
her thoughts from her appearance.&nbsp; The turn of her wrist,
the still sound of her voice, the light in her eyes, the lines of
her body, fell in tune with her grave and gentle words, like the
accompaniment that sustains and harmonises the voice of the
singer.&nbsp; Her influence was one thing, not to be divided or
discussed, only to be felt with gratitude and joy.&nbsp; To Will,
her presence recalled something of his childhood, and the thought
of her took its place in his mind beside that of dawn, of running
water, and of the earliest violets and lilacs.&nbsp; It is the
property of things seen for the first time, or for the first time
after long, like the flowers in spring, to reawaken in us the
sharp edge of sense and that impression of mystic strangeness
which otherwise passes out of life with the coming of years; but
the sight of a loved face is what renews a man&rsquo;s character
from the fountain upwards.</p>
<p>One day after dinner Will took a stroll among the firs; a
grave beatitude possessed him from top to toe, and he kept
smiling to himself and the landscape as he went.&nbsp; The river
ran between the stepping-stones with a pretty wimple; a bird sang
loudly in the wood; the hill-tops looked immeasurably high, and
as he glanced at them from time to time seemed to contemplate his
movements with a beneficent but awful curiosity.&nbsp; His way
took him to the eminence which overlooked the plain; and there he
sat down upon a stone, and fell into deep and pleasant
thought.&nbsp; The plain lay abroad with its cities and silver
river; everything was asleep, except a great eddy of birds which
kept rising and falling and going round and round in the blue
air.&nbsp; He repeated Marjory&rsquo;s name aloud, and the sound
of it gratified his ear.&nbsp; He shut his eyes, and her image
sprang up before him, quietly luminous and attended with good
thoughts.&nbsp; The river might run for ever; the birds fly
higher and higher till they touched the stars.&nbsp; He saw it
was empty bustle after all; for here, without stirring a feet,
waiting patiently in his own narrow valley, he also had attained
the better sunlight.</p>
<p>The next day Will made a sort of declaration across the
dinner-table, while the parson was filling his pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Marjory,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I never knew any
one I liked so well as you.&nbsp; I am mostly a cold, unkindly
sort of man; not from want of heart, but out of strangeness in my
way of thinking; and people seem far away from me.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis as if there were a circle round me, which kept every
one out but you; I can hear the others talking and laughing; but
you come quite close.&nbsp; Maybe, this is disagreeable to
you?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Marjory made no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak up, girl,&rsquo; said the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, now,&rsquo; returned Will, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
press her, parson.&nbsp; I feel tongue-tied myself, who am not
used to it; and she&rsquo;s a woman, and little more than a
child, when all is said.&nbsp; But for my part, as far as I can
understand what people mean by it, I fancy I must be what they
call in love.&nbsp; I do not wish to be held as committing
myself; for I may be wrong; but that is how I believe things are
with me.&nbsp; And if Miss Marjory should feel any otherwise on
her part, mayhap she would be so kind as shake her
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marjory was silent, and gave no sign that she had heard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is that, parson?&rsquo; asked Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The girl must speak,&rsquo; replied the parson, laying
down his pipe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s our neighbour who says
he loves you, Madge.&nbsp; Do you love him, ay or no?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I do,&rsquo; said Marjory, faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s all that could be
wished!&rsquo; cried Will, heartily.&nbsp; And he took her hand
across the table, and held it a moment in both of his with great
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must marry,&rsquo; observed the parson, replacing
his pipe in his mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that the right thing to do, think you?&rsquo;
demanded Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is indispensable,&rsquo; said the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied the wooer.</p>
<p>Two or three days passed away with great delight to Will,
although a bystander might scarce have found it out.&nbsp; He
continued to take his meals opposite Marjory, and to talk with
her and gaze upon her in her father&rsquo;s presence; but he made
no attempt to see her alone, nor in any other way changed his
conduct towards her from what it had been since the
beginning.&nbsp; Perhaps the girl was a little disappointed, and
perhaps not unjustly; and yet if it had been enough to be always
in the thoughts of another person, and so pervade and alter his
whole life, she might have been thoroughly contented.&nbsp; For
she was never out of Will&rsquo;s mind for an instant.&nbsp; He
sat over the stream, and watched the dust of the eddy, and the
poised fish, and straining weeds; he wandered out alone into the
purple even, with all the blackbirds piping round him in the
wood; he rose early in the morning, and saw the sky turn from
grey to gold, and the light leap upon the hill-tops; and all the
while he kept wondering if he had never seen such things before,
or how it was that they should look so different now.&nbsp; The
sound of his own mill-wheel, or of the wind among the trees,
confounded and charmed his heart.&nbsp; The most enchanting
thoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind.&nbsp; He was
so happy that he could not sleep at night, and so restless, that
he could hardly sit still out of her company.&nbsp; And yet it
seemed as if he avoided her rather than sought her out.</p>
<p>One day, as he was coming home from a ramble, Will found
Marjory in the garden picking flowers, and as he came up with
her, slackened his pace and continued walking by her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You like flowers?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I love them dearly,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;not so much.&nbsp; They
are a very small affair, when all is done.&nbsp; I can fancy
people caring for them greatly, but not doing as you are just
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; she asked, pausing and looking up at
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plucking them,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are a
deal better off where they are, and look a deal prettier, if you
go to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to have them for my own,&rsquo; she answered,
&lsquo;to carry them near my heart, and keep them in my
room.&nbsp; They tempt me when they grow here; they seem to say,
&ldquo;Come and do something with us;&rdquo; but once I have cut
them and put them by, the charm is laid, and I can look at them
with quite an easy heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wish to possess them,&rsquo; replied Will,
&lsquo;in order to think no more about them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
bit like killing the goose with the golden eggs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a bit like what I wished to do when I was a boy.&nbsp; Because I
had a fancy for looking out over the plain, I wished to go down
there&mdash;where I couldn&rsquo;t look out over it any
longer.&nbsp; Was not that fine reasoning?&nbsp; Dear, dear, if
they only thought of it, all the world would do like me; and you
would let your flowers alone, just as I stay up here in the
mountains.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suddenly he broke off sharp.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By the Lord!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; And when she asked him
what was wrong, he turned the question off and walked away into
the house with rather a humorous expression of face.</p>
<p>He was silent at table; and after the night hid fallen and the
stars had come out overhead, he walked up and down for hours in
the courtyard and garden with an uneven pace.&nbsp; There was
still a light in the window of Marjory&rsquo;s room: one little
oblong patch of orange in a world of dark blue hills and silver
starlight.&nbsp; Will&rsquo;s mind ran a great deal on the
window; but his thoughts were not very lover-like.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There she is in her room,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and
there are the stars overhead:&mdash;a blessing upon
both!&rsquo;&nbsp; Both were good influences in his life; both
soothed and braced him in his profound contentment with the
world.&nbsp; And what more should he desire with either?&nbsp;
The fat young man and his councils were so present to his mind,
that he threw back his head, and, putting his hands before his
mouth, shouted aloud to the populous heavens.&nbsp; Whether from
the position of his head or the sudden strain of the exertion, he
seemed to see a momentary shock among the stars, and a diffusion
of frosty light pass from one to another along the sky.&nbsp; At
the same instant, a corner of the blind was lifted and lowered
again at once.&nbsp; He laughed a loud ho-ho!&nbsp; &lsquo;One
and another!&rsquo; thought Will.&nbsp; &lsquo;The stars tremble,
and the blind goes up.&nbsp; Why, before Heaven, what a great
magician I must be!&nbsp; Now if I were only a fool, should not I
be in a pretty way?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he went off to bed,
chuckling to himself: &lsquo;If I were only a fool!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, pretty early, he saw her once more in the
garden, and sought her out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking about getting married,&rsquo; he
began abruptly; &lsquo;and after having turned it all over, I
have made up my mind it&rsquo;s not worthwhile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned upon him for a single moment; but his radiant,
kindly appearance would, under the circumstances, have
disconcerted an angel, and she looked down again upon the ground
in silence.&nbsp; He could see her tremble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; he went on, a
little taken aback.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought not.&nbsp; I have
turned it all over, and upon my soul there&rsquo;s nothing in
it.&nbsp; We should never be one whit nearer than we are just
now, and, if I am a wise man, nothing like so happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is unnecessary to go round about with me,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I very well remember that you refused to
commit yourself; and now that I see you were mistaken, and in
reality have never cared for me, I can only feel sad that I have
been so far misled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask your pardon,&rsquo; said Will stoutly; &lsquo;you
do not understand my meaning.&nbsp; As to whether I have ever
loved you or not, I must leave that to others.&nbsp; But for one
thing, my feeling is not changed; and for another, you may make
it your boast that you have made my whole life and character
something different from what they were.&nbsp; I mean what I say;
no less.&nbsp; I do not think getting married is worth
while.&nbsp; I would rather you went on living with your father,
so that I could walk over and see you once, or maybe twice a
week, as people go to church, and then we should both be all the
happier between whiles.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my notion.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll marry you if you will,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know that you are insulting me?&rsquo; she broke
out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I, Marjory,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;if there is
anything in a clear conscience, not I.&nbsp; I offer all my
heart&rsquo;s best affection; you can take it or want it, though
I suspect it&rsquo;s beyond either your power or mine to change
what has once been done, and set me fancy-free.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
marry you, if you like; but I tell you again and again,
it&rsquo;s not worth while, and we had best stay friends.&nbsp;
Though I am a quiet man I have noticed a heap of things in my
life.&nbsp; Trust in me, and take things as I propose; or, if you
don&rsquo;t like that, say the word, and I&rsquo;ll marry you out
of hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a considerable pause, and Will, who began to feel
uneasy, began to grow angry in consequence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems you are too proud to say your mind,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Believe me that&rsquo;s a pity.&nbsp; A clean
shrift makes simple living.&nbsp; Can a man be more downright or
honourable, to a woman than I have been?&nbsp; I have said my
say, and given you your choice.&nbsp; Do you want me to marry
you? or will you take my friendship, as I think best? or have you
had enough of me for good?&nbsp; Speak out for the dear
God&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; You know your father told you a girl
should speak her mind in these affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to recover herself at that, turned without a word,
walked rapidly through the garden, and disappeared into the
house, leaving Will in some confusion as to the result.&nbsp; He
walked up and down the garden, whistling softly to himself.&nbsp;
Sometimes he stopped and contemplated the sky and hill-tops;
sometimes he went down to the tail of the weir and sat there,
looking foolishly in the water.&nbsp; All this dubiety and
perturbation was so foreign to his nature and the life which he
had resolutely chosen for himself, that he began to regret
Marjory&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he
thought, &lsquo;I was as happy as a man need be.&nbsp; I could
come down here and watch my fishes all day long if I wanted: I
was as settled and contented as my old mill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marjory came down to dinner, looking very trim and quiet; and
no sooner were all three at table than she made her father a
speech, with her eyes fixed upon her plate, but showing no other
sign of embarrassment or distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she began, &lsquo;Mr. Will and I have
been talking things over.&nbsp; We see that we have each made a
mistake about our feelings, and he has agreed, at my request, to
give up all idea of marriage, and be no more than my very good
friend, as in the past.&nbsp; You see, there is no shadow of a
quarrel, and indeed I hope we shall see a great deal of him in
the future, for his visits will always be welcome in our
house.&nbsp; Of course, father, you will know best, but perhaps
we should do better to leave Mr. Will&rsquo;s house for the
present.&nbsp; I believe, after what has passed, we should hardly
be agreeable inmates for some days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will, who had commanded himself with difficulty from the
first, broke out upon this into an inarticulate noise, and raised
one hand with an appearance of real dismay, as if he were about
to interfere and contradict.&nbsp; But she checked him at once
looking up at him with a swift glance and an angry flush upon her
cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will perhaps have the good grace,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;to let me explain these matters for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will was put entirely out of countenance by her expression and
the ring of her voice.&nbsp; He held his peace, concluding that
there were some things about this girl beyond his comprehension,
in which he was exactly right.</p>
<p>The poor parson was quite crestfallen.&nbsp; He tried to prove
that this was no more than a true lovers&rsquo; tiff, which would
pass off before night; and when he was dislodged from that
position, he went on to argue that where there was no quarrel
there could be no call for a separation; for the good man liked
both his entertainment and his host.&nbsp; It was curious to see
how the girl managed them, saying little all the time, and that
very quietly, and yet twisting them round her finger and
insensibly leading them wherever she would by feminine tact and
generalship.&nbsp; It scarcely seemed to have been her
doing&mdash;it seemed as if things had merely so fallen
out&mdash;that she and her father took their departure that same
afternoon in a farm-cart, and went farther down the valley, to
wait, until their own house was ready for them, in another
hamlet.&nbsp; But Will had been observing closely, and was well
aware of her dexterity and resolution.&nbsp; When he found
himself alone he had a great many curious matters to turn over in
his mind.&nbsp; He was very sad and solitary, to begin
with.&nbsp; All the interest had gone out of his life, and he
might look up at the stars as long as he pleased, he somehow
failed to find support or consolation.&nbsp; And then he was in
such a turmoil of spirit about Marjory.&nbsp; He had been puzzled
and irritated at her behaviour, and yet he could not keep himself
from admiring it.&nbsp; He thought he recognised a fine, perverse
angel in that still soul which he had never hitherto suspected;
and though he saw it was an influence that would fit but ill with
his own life of artificial calm, he could not keep himself from
ardently desiring to possess it.&nbsp; Like a man who has lived
among shadows and now meets the sun, he was both pained and
delighted.</p>
<p>As the days went forward he passed from one extreme to
another; now pluming himself on the strength of his
determination, now despising his timid and silly caution.&nbsp;
The former was, perhaps, the true thought of his heart, and
represented the regular tenor of the man&rsquo;s reflections; but
the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence,
and then he would forget all consideration, and go up and down
his house and garden or walk among the fir-woods like one who is
beside himself with remorse.&nbsp; To equable, steady-minded Will
this state of matters was intolerable; and he determined, at
whatever cost, to bring it to an end.&nbsp; So, one warm summer
afternoon he put on his best clothes, took a thorn switch in his
hand, and set out down the valley by the river.&nbsp; As soon as
he had taken his determination, he had regained at a bound his
customary peace of heart, and he enjoyed the bright weather and
the variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or
unpleasant eagerness.&nbsp; It was nearly the same to him how the
matter turned out.&nbsp; If she accepted him he would have to
marry her this time, which perhaps was, all for the best.&nbsp;
If she refused him, he would have done his utmost, and might
follow his own way in the future with an untroubled
conscience.&nbsp; He hoped, on the whole, she would refuse him;
and then, again, as he saw the brown roof which sheltered her,
peeping through some willows at an angle of the stream, he was
half inclined to reverse the wish, and more than half ashamed of
himself for this infirmity of purpose.</p>
<p>Marjory seemed glad to see him, and gave him her hand without
affectation or delay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking about this marriage,&rsquo; he
began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So have I,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I
respect you more and more for a very wise man.&nbsp; You
understood me better than I understood myself; and I am now quite
certain that things are all for the best as they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the same time&mdash;,&rsquo; ventured Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be tired,&rsquo; she interrupted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take a seat and let me fetch you a glass of wine.&nbsp;
The afternoon is so warm; and I wish you not to be displeased
with your visit.&nbsp; You must come quite often; once a week, if
you can spare the time; I am always so glad to see my
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, very well,&rsquo; thought Will to himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It appears I was right after all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he paid
a very agreeable visit, walked home again in capital spirits, and
gave himself no further concern about the matter.</p>
<p>For nearly three years Will and Marjory continued on these
terms, seeing each other once or twice a week without any word of
love between them; and for all that time I believe Will was
nearly as happy as a man can be.&nbsp; He rather stinted himself
the pleasure of seeing her; and he would often walk half-way over
to the parsonage, and then back again, as if to whet his
appetite.&nbsp; Indeed there was one corner of the road, whence
he could see the church-spire wedged into a crevice of the valley
between sloping firwoods, with a triangular snatch of plain by
way of background, which he greatly affected as a place to sit
and moralise in before returning homewards; and the peasants got
so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight that
they gave it the name of &lsquo;Will o&rsquo; the Mill&rsquo;s
Corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the three years Marjory played him a sad trick
by suddenly marrying somebody else.&nbsp; Will kept his
countenance bravely, and merely remarked that, for as little as
he knew of women, he had acted very prudently in not marrying her
himself three years before.&nbsp; She plainly knew very little of
her own mind, and, in spite of a deceptive manner, was as fickle
and flighty as the rest of them.&nbsp; He had to congratulate
himself on an escape, he said, and would take a higher opinion of
his own wisdom in consequence.&nbsp; But at heart, he was
reasonably displeased, moped a good deal for a month or two, and
fell away in flesh, to the astonishment of his serving-lads.</p>
<p>It was perhaps a year after this marriage that Will was
awakened late one night by the sound of a horse galloping on the
road, followed by precipitate knocking at the inn-door.&nbsp; He
opened his window and saw a farm servant, mounted and holding a
led horse by the bridle, who told him to make what haste he could
and go along with him; for Marjory was dying, and had sent
urgently to fetch him to her bedside.&nbsp; Will was no horseman,
and made so little speed upon the way that the poor young wife
was very near her end before he arrived.&nbsp; But they had some
minutes&rsquo; talk in private, and he was present and wept very
bitterly while she breathed her last.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; DEATH</h3>
<p>Year after year went away into nothing, with great explosions
and outcries in the cities on the plain: red revolt springing up
and being suppressed in blood, battle swaying hither and thither,
patient astronomers in observatory towers picking out and
christening new stars, plays being performed in lighted theatres,
people being carried into hospital on stretchers, and all the
usual turmoil and agitation of men&rsquo;s lives in crowded
centres.&nbsp; Up in Will&rsquo;s valley only the winds and
seasons made an epoch; the fish hung in the swift stream, the
birds circled overhead, the pine-tops rustled underneath the
stars, the tall hills stood over all; and Will went to and fro,
minding his wayside inn, until the snow began to thicken on his
head.&nbsp; His heart was young and vigorous; and if his pulses
kept a sober time, they still beat strong and steady in his
wrists.&nbsp; He carried a ruddy stain on either cheek, like a
ripe apple; he stooped a little, but his step was still firm; and
his sinewy hands were reached out to all men with a friendly
pressure.&nbsp; His face was covered with those wrinkles which
are got in open air, and which rightly looked at, are no more
than a sort of permanent sunburning; such wrinkles heighten the
stupidity of stupid faces; but to a person like Will, with his
clear eyes and smiling mouth, only give another charm by
testifying to a simple and easy life.&nbsp; His talk was full of
wise sayings.&nbsp; He had a taste for other people; and other
people had a taste for him.&nbsp; When the valley was full of
tourists in the season, there were merry nights in Will&rsquo;s
arbour; and his views, which seemed whimsical to his neighbours,
were often enough admired by learned people out of towns and
colleges.&nbsp; Indeed, he had a very noble old age, and grew
daily better known; so that his fame was heard of in the cities
of the plain; and young men who had been summer travellers spoke
together in <i>caf&eacute;s</i> of Will o&rsquo; the Mill and his
rough philosophy.&nbsp; Many and many an invitation, you may be
sure, he had; but nothing could tempt him from his upland
valley.&nbsp; He would shake his head and smile over his
tobacco-pipe with a deal of meaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;You come too
late,&rsquo; he would answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a dead man now: I
have lived and died already.&nbsp; Fifty years ago you would have
brought my heart into my mouth; and now you do not even tempt
me.&nbsp; But that is the object of long living, that man should
cease to care about life.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again: &lsquo;There is
only one difference between a long life and a good dinner: that,
in the dinner, the sweets come last.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or once more:
&lsquo;When I was a boy, I was a bit puzzled, and hardly knew
whether it was myself or the world that was curious and worth
looking into.&nbsp; Now, I know it is myself, and stick to
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He never showed any symptom of frailty, but kept stalwart and
firm to the last; but they say he grew less talkative towards the
end, and would listen to other people by the hour in an amused
and sympathetic silence.&nbsp; Only, when he did speak, it was
more to the point and more charged with old experience.&nbsp; He
drank a bottle of wine gladly; above all, at sunset on the
hill-top or quite late at night under the stars in the
arbour.&nbsp; The sight of something attractive and unatttainable
seasoned his enjoyment, he would say; and he professed he had
lived long enough to admire a candle all the more when he could
compare it with a planet.</p>
<p>One night, in his seventy-second year, he awoke in bed in such
uneasiness of body and mind that he arose and dressed himself and
went out to meditate in the arbour.&nbsp; It was pitch dark,
without a star; the river was swollen, and the wet woods and
meadows loaded the air with perfume.&nbsp; It had thundered
during the day, and it promised more thunder for the
morrow.&nbsp; A murky, stifling night for a man of
seventy-two!&nbsp; Whether it was the weather or the wakefulness,
or some little touch of fever in his old limbs, Will&rsquo;s mind
was besieged by tumultuous and crying memories.&nbsp; His
boyhood, the night with the fat young man, the death of his
adopted parents, the summer days with Marjory, and many of those
small circumstances, which seem nothing to another, and are yet
the very gist of a man&rsquo;s own life to himself&mdash;things
seen, words heard, looks misconstrued&mdash;arose from their
forgotten corners and usurped his attention.&nbsp; The dead
themselves were with him, not merely taking part in this thin
show of memory that defiled before his brain, but revisiting his
bodily senses as they do in profound and vivid dreams.&nbsp; The
fat young man leaned his elbows on the table opposite; Marjory
came and went with an apronful of flowers between the garden and
the arbour; he could hear the old parson knocking out his pipe or
blowing his resonant nose.&nbsp; The tide of his consciousness
ebbed and flowed: he was sometimes half-asleep and drowned in his
recollections of the past; and sometimes he was broad awake,
wondering at himself.&nbsp; But about the middle of the night he
was startled by the voice of the dead miller calling to him out
of the house as he used to do on the arrival of custom.&nbsp; The
hallucination was so perfect that Will sprang from his seat and
stood listening for the summons to be repeated; and as he
listened he became conscious of another noise besides the
brawling of the river and the ringing in his feverish ears.&nbsp;
It was like the stir of horses and the creaking of harness, as
though a carriage with an impatient team had been brought up upon
the road before the courtyard gate.&nbsp; At such an hour, upon
this rough and dangerous pass, the supposition was no better than
absurd; and Will dismissed it from his mind, and resumed his seat
upon the arbour chair; and sleep closed over him again like
running water.&nbsp; He was once again awakened by the dead
miller&rsquo;s call, thinner and more spectral than before; and
once again he heard the noise of an equipage upon the road.&nbsp;
And so thrice and four times, the same dream, or the same fancy,
presented itself to his senses: until at length, smiling to
himself as when one humours a nervous child, he proceeded towards
the gate to set his uncertainty at rest.</p>
<p>From the arbour to the gate was no great distance, and yet it
took Will some time; it seemed as if the dead thickened around
him in the court, and crossed his path at every step.&nbsp; For,
first, he was suddenly surprised by an overpowering sweetness of
heliotropes; it was as if his garden had been planted with this
flower from end to end, and the hot, damp night had drawn forth
all their perfumes in a breath.&nbsp; Now the heliotrope had been
Marjory&rsquo;s favourite flower, and since her death not one of
them had ever been planted in Will&rsquo;s ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must be going crazy,&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor Marjory and her heliotropes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with that he raised his eyes towards the window that had
once been hers.&nbsp; If he had been bewildered before, he was
now almost terrified; for there was a light in the room; the
window was an orange oblong as of yore; and the corner of the
blind was lifted and let fall as on the night when he stood and
shouted to the stars in his perplexity.&nbsp; The illusion only
endured an instant; but it left him somewhat unmanned, rubbing
his eyes and staring at the outline of the house and the black
night behind it.&nbsp; While he thus stood, and it seemed as if
he must have stood there quite a long time, there came a renewal
of the noises on the road: and he turned in time to meet a
stranger, who was advancing to meet him across the court.&nbsp;
There was something like the outline of a great carriage
discernible on the road behind the stranger, and, above that, a
few black pine-tops, like so many plumes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Will?&rsquo; asked the new-comer, in brief
military fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That same, sir,&rsquo; answered Will.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can
I do anything to serve you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard you much spoken of, Master Will,&rsquo;
returned the other; &lsquo;much spoken of, and well.&nbsp; And
though I have both hands full of business, I wish to drink a
bottle of wine with you in your arbour.&nbsp; Before I go, I
shall introduce myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will led the way to the trellis, and got a lamp lighted and a
bottle uncorked.&nbsp; He was not altogether unused to such
complimentary interviews, and hoped little enough from this one,
being schooled by many disappointments.&nbsp; A sort of cloud had
settled on his wits and prevented him from remembering the
strangeness of the hour.&nbsp; He moved like a person in his
sleep; and it seemed as if the lamp caught fire and the bottle
came uncorked with the facility of thought.&nbsp; Still, he had
some curiosity about the appearance of his visitor, and tried in
vain to turn the light into his face; either he handled the lamp
clumsily, or there was a dimness over his eyes; but he could make
out little more than a shadow at table with him.&nbsp; He stared
and stared at this shadow, as he wiped out the glasses, and began
to feel cold and strange about the heart.&nbsp; The silence
weighed upon him, for he could hear nothing now, not even the
river, but the drumming of his own arteries in his ears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to you,&rsquo; said the stranger,
roughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is my service, sir,&rsquo; replied Will, sipping
his wine, which somehow tasted oddly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand you are a very positive fellow,&rsquo;
pursued the stranger.</p>
<p>Will made answer with a smile of some satisfaction and a
little nod.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; continued the other; &lsquo;and it is
the delight of my heart to tramp on people&rsquo;s corns.&nbsp; I
will have nobody positive but myself; not one.&nbsp; I have
crossed the whims, in my time, of kings and generals and great
artists.&nbsp; And what would you say,&rsquo; he went on,
&lsquo;if I had come up here on purpose to cross
yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will had it on his tongue to make a sharp rejoinder; but the
politeness of an old innkeeper prevailed; and he held his peace
and made answer with a civil gesture of the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if I
did not hold you in a particular esteem, I should make no words
about the matter.&nbsp; It appears you pride yourself on staying
where you are.&nbsp; You mean to stick by your inn.&nbsp; Now I
mean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche; and before
this bottle&rsquo;s empty, so you shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would be an odd thing, to be sure,&rsquo; replied
Will, with a chuckle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, sir, I have grown here
like an old oak-tree; the Devil himself could hardly root me up:
and for all I perceive you are a very entertaining old gentleman,
I would wager you another bottle you lose your pains with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dimness of Will&rsquo;s eyesight had been increasing all
this while; but he was somehow conscious of a sharp and chilling
scrutiny which irritated and yet overmastered him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not think,&rsquo; he broke out suddenly, in an
explosive, febrile manner that startled and alarmed himself,
&lsquo;that I am a stay-at-home, because I fear anything under
God.&nbsp; God knows I am tired enough of it all; and when the
time comes for a longer journey than ever you dream of, I reckon
I shall find myself prepared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stranger emptied his glass and pushed it away from
him.&nbsp; He looked down for a little, and then, leaning over
the table, tapped Will three times upon the forearm with a single
finger.&nbsp; &lsquo;The time has come!&rsquo; he said
solemnly.</p>
<p>An ugly thrill spread from the spot he touched.&nbsp; The
tones of his voice were dull and startling, and echoed strangely
in Will&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said, with some
discomposure.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at me, and you will find your eyesight swim.&nbsp;
Raise your hand; it is dead-heavy.&nbsp; This is your last bottle
of wine, Master Will, and your last night upon the
earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a doctor?&rsquo; quavered Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best that ever was,&rsquo; replied the other;
&lsquo;for I cure both mind and body with the same
prescription.&nbsp; I take away all pain and I forgive all sins;
and where my patients have gone wrong in life, I smooth out all
complications and set them free again upon their feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no need of you,&rsquo; said Will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A time comes for all men, Master Will,&rsquo; replied
the doctor, &lsquo;when the helm is taken out of their
hands.&nbsp; For you, because you were prudent and quiet, it has
been long of coming, and you have had long to discipline yourself
for its reception.&nbsp; You have seen what is to be seen about
your mill; you have sat close all your days like a hare in its
form; but now that is at an end; and,&rsquo; added the doctor,
getting on his feet, &lsquo;you must arise and come with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a strange physician,&rsquo; said Will, looking
steadfastly upon his guest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a natural law,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and
people call me Death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you not tell me so at first?&rsquo; cried
Will.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been waiting for you these many
years.&nbsp; Give me your hand, and welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lean upon my arm,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;for
already your strength abates.&nbsp; Lean on me as heavily as you
need; for though I am old, I am very strong.&nbsp; It is but
three steps to my carriage, and there all your trouble
ends.&nbsp; Why, Will,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I have been
yearning for you as if you were my own son; and of all the men
that ever I came for in my long days, I have come for you most
gladly.&nbsp; I am caustic, and sometimes offend people at first
sight; but I am a good friend at heart to such as you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since Marjory was taken,&rsquo; returned Will, &lsquo;I
declare before God you were the only friend I had to look
for.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the pair went arm-in-arm across the
courtyard.</p>
<p>One of the servants awoke about this time and heard the noise
of horses pawing before he dropped asleep again; all down the
valley that night there was a rushing as of a smooth and steady
wind descending towards the plain; and when the world rose next
morning, sure enough Will o&rsquo; the Mill had gone at last upon
his travels.</p>
<h2>MARKHEIM</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the dealer, &lsquo;our windfalls are
of various kinds.&nbsp; Some customers are ignorant, and then I
touch a dividend on my superior knowledge.&nbsp; Some are
dishonest,&rsquo; and here he held up the candle, so that the
light fell strongly on his visitor, &lsquo;and in that
case,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;I profit by my
virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Markheim had but just entered from the daylight streets, and
his eyes had not yet grown familiar with the mingled shine and
darkness in the shop.&nbsp; At these pointed words, and before
the near presence of the flame, he blinked painfully and looked
aside.</p>
<p>The dealer chuckled.&nbsp; &lsquo;You come to me on Christmas
Day,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;when you know that I am alone in
my house, put up my shutters, and make a point of refusing
business.&nbsp; Well, you will have to pay for that; you will
have to pay for my loss of time, when I should be balancing my
books; you will have to pay, besides, for a kind of manner that I
remark in you to-day very strongly.&nbsp; I am the essence of
discretion, and ask no awkward questions; but when a customer
cannot look me in the eye, he has to pay for it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
dealer once more chuckled; and then, changing to his usual
business voice, though still with a note of irony, &lsquo;You can
give, as usual, a clear account of how you came into the
possession of the object?&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still
your uncle&rsquo;s cabinet?&nbsp; A remarkable collector,
sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the little pale, round-shouldered dealer stood almost on
tip-toe, looking over the top of his gold spectacles, and nodding
his head with every mark of disbelief.&nbsp; Markheim returned
his gaze with one of infinite pity, and a touch of horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This time,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are in
error.&nbsp; I have not come to sell, but to buy.&nbsp; I have no
curios to dispose of; my uncle&rsquo;s cabinet is bare to the
wainscot; even were it still intact, I have done well on the
Stock Exchange, and should more likely add to it than otherwise,
and my errand to-day is simplicity itself.&nbsp; I seek a
Christmas present for a lady,&rsquo; he continued, waxing more
fluent as he struck into the speech he had prepared; &lsquo;and
certainly I owe you every excuse for thus disturbing you upon so
small a matter.&nbsp; But the thing was neglected yesterday; I
must produce my little compliment at dinner; and, as you very
well know, a rich marriage is not a thing to be
neglected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There followed a pause, during which the dealer seemed to
weigh this statement incredulously.&nbsp; The ticking of many
clocks among the curious lumber of the shop, and the faint
rushing of the cabs in a near thoroughfare, filled up the
interval of silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said the dealer, &lsquo;be it
so.&nbsp; You are an old customer after all; and if, as you say,
you have the chance of a good marriage, far be it from me to be
an obstacle.&nbsp; Here is a nice thing for a lady now,&rsquo; he
went on, &lsquo;this hand glass&mdash;fifteenth century,
warranted; comes from a good collection, too; but I reserve the
name, in the interests of my customer, who was just like
yourself, my dear sir, the nephew and sole heir of a remarkable
collector.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dealer, while he thus ran on in his dry and biting voice,
had stooped to take the object from its place; and, as he had
done so, a shock had passed through Markheim, a start both of
hand and foot, a sudden leap of many tumultuous passions to the
face.&nbsp; It passed as swiftly as it came, and left no trace
beyond a certain trembling of the hand that now received the
glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A glass,&rsquo; he said hoarsely, and then paused, and
repeated it more clearly.&nbsp; &lsquo;A glass?&nbsp; For
Christmas?&nbsp; Surely not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; cried the dealer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why
not a glass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Markheim was looking upon him with an indefinable
expression.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ask me why not?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, look here&mdash;look in it&mdash;look at
yourself!&nbsp; Do you like to see it?&nbsp; No! nor I&mdash;nor
any man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little man had jumped back when Markheim had so suddenly
confronted him with the mirror; but now, perceiving there was
nothing worse on hand, he chuckled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your future
lady, sir, must be pretty hard favoured,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask you,&rsquo; said Markheim, &lsquo;for a Christmas
present, and you give me this&mdash;this damned reminder of
years, and sins and follies&mdash;this hand-conscience!&nbsp; Did
you mean it?&nbsp; Had you a thought in your mind?&nbsp; Tell
me.&nbsp; It will be better for you if you do.&nbsp; Come, tell
me about yourself.&nbsp; I hazard a guess now, that you are in
secret a very charitable man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dealer looked closely at his companion.&nbsp; It was very
odd, Markheim did not appear to be laughing; there was something
in his face like an eager sparkle of hope, but nothing of
mirth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you driving at?&rsquo; the dealer asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not charitable?&rsquo; returned the other,
gloomily.&nbsp; Not charitable; not pious; not scrupulous;
unloving, unbeloved; a hand to get money, a safe to keep
it.&nbsp; Is that all?&nbsp; Dear God, man, is that
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you what it is,&rsquo; began the dealer,
with some sharpness, and then broke off again into a
chuckle.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I see this is a love match of yours,
and you have been drinking the lady&rsquo;s health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Markheim, with a strange
curiosity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, have you been in love?&nbsp; Tell me
about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I,&rsquo; cried the dealer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I in
love!&nbsp; I never had the time, nor have I the time to-day for
all this nonsense.&nbsp; Will you take the glass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the hurry?&rsquo; returned Markheim.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is very pleasant to stand here talking; and life is so
short and insecure that I would not hurry away from any
pleasure&mdash;no, not even from so mild a one as this.&nbsp; We
should rather cling, cling to what little we can get, like a man
at a cliff&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; Every second is a cliff, if you
think upon it&mdash;a cliff a mile high&mdash;high enough, if we
fall, to dash us out of every feature of humanity.&nbsp; Hence it
is best to talk pleasantly.&nbsp; Let us talk of each other: why
should we wear this mask?&nbsp; Let us be confidential.&nbsp; Who
knows, we might become friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just one word to say to you,&rsquo; said the
dealer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Either make your purchase, or walk out of my
shop!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True true,&rsquo; said Markheim.&nbsp; &lsquo;Enough,
fooling.&nbsp; To business.&nbsp; Show me something
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dealer stooped once more, this time to replace the glass
upon the shelf, his thin blond hair falling over his eyes as he
did so.&nbsp; Markheim moved a little nearer, with one hand in
the pocket of his greatcoat; he drew himself up and filled his
lungs; at the same time many different emotions were depicted
together on his face&mdash;terror, horror, and resolve,
fascination and a physical repulsion; and through a haggard lift
of his upper lip, his teeth looked out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This, perhaps, may suit,&rsquo; observed the dealer:
and then, as he began to re-arise, Markheim bounded from behind
upon his victim.&nbsp; The long, skewerlike dagger flashed and
fell.&nbsp; The dealer struggled like a hen, striking his temple
on the shelf, and then tumbled on the floor in a heap.</p>
<p>Time had some score of small voices in that shop, some stately
and slow as was becoming to their great age; others garrulous and
hurried.&nbsp; All these told out the seconds in an intricate,
chorus of tickings.&nbsp; Then the passage of a lad&rsquo;s feet,
heavily running on the pavement, broke in upon these smaller
voices and startled Markheim into the consciousness of his
surroundings.&nbsp; He looked about him awfully.&nbsp; The candle
stood on the counter, its flame solemnly wagging in a draught;
and by that inconsiderable movement, the whole room was filled
with noiseless bustle and kept heaving like a sea: the tall
shadows nodding, the gross blots of darkness swelling and
dwindling as with respiration, the faces of the portraits and the
china gods changing and wavering like images in water.&nbsp; The
inner door stood ajar, and peered into that leaguer of shadows
with a long slit of daylight like a pointing finger.</p>
<p>From these fear-stricken rovings, Markheim&rsquo;s eyes
returned to the body of his victim, where it lay both humped and
sprawling, incredibly small and strangely meaner than in
life.&nbsp; In these poor, miserly clothes, in that ungainly
attitude, the dealer lay like so much sawdust.&nbsp; Markheim had
feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing.&nbsp; And yet, as he
gazed, this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find
eloquent voices.&nbsp; There it must lie; there was none to work
the cunning hinges or direct the miracle of
locomotion&mdash;there it must lie till it was found.&nbsp;
Found! ay, and then?&nbsp; Then would this dead flesh lift up a
cry that would ring over England, and fill the world with the
echoes of pursuit.&nbsp; Ay, dead or not, this was still the
enemy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Time was that when the brains were
out,&rsquo; he thought; and the first word struck into his
mind.&nbsp; Time, now that the deed was accomplished&mdash;time,
which had closed for the victim, had become instant and momentous
for the slayer.</p>
<p>The thought was yet in his mind, when, first one and then
another, with every variety of pace and voice&mdash;one deep as
the bell from a cathedral turret, another ringing on its treble
notes the prelude of a waltz-the clocks began to strike the hour
of three in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb chamber
staggered him.&nbsp; He began to bestir himself, going to and fro
with the candle, beleaguered by moving shadows, and startled to
the soul by chance reflections.&nbsp; In many rich mirrors, some
of home design, some from Venice or Amsterdam, he saw his face
repeated and repeated, as it were an army of spies; his own eyes
met and detected him; and the sound of his own steps, lightly as
they fell, vexed the surrounding quiet.&nbsp; And still, as he
continued to fill his pockets, his mind accused him with a
sickening iteration, of the thousand faults of his design.&nbsp;
He should have chosen a more quiet hour; he should have prepared
an alibi; he should not have used a knife; he should have been
more cautious, and only bound and gagged the dealer, and not
killed him; he should have been more bold, and killed the servant
also; he should have done all things otherwise: poignant regrets,
weary, incessant toiling of the mind to change what was
unchangeable, to plan what was now useless, to be the architect
of the irrevocable past.&nbsp; Meanwhile, and behind all this
activity, brute terrors, like the scurrying of rats in a deserted
attic, filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot;
the hand of the constable would fall heavy on his shoulder, and
his nerves would jerk like a hooked fish; or he beheld, in
galloping defile, the dock, the prison, the gallows, and the
black coffin.</p>
<p>Terror of the people in the street sat down before his mind
like a besieging army.&nbsp; It was impossible, he thought, but
that some rumour of the struggle must have reached their ears and
set on edge their curiosity; and now, in all the neighbouring
houses, he divined them sitting motionless and with uplifted
ear&mdash;solitary people, condemned to spend Christmas dwelling
alone on memories of the past, and now startingly recalled from
that tender exercise; happy family parties struck into silence
round the table, the mother still with raised finger: every
degree and age and humour, but all, by their own hearths, prying
and hearkening and weaving the rope that was to hang him.&nbsp;
Sometimes it seemed to him he could not move too softly; the
clink of the tall Bohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell;
and alarmed by the bigness of the ticking, he was tempted to stop
the clocks.&nbsp; And then, again, with a swift transition of his
terrors, the very silence of the place appeared a source of
peril, and a thing to strike and freeze the passer-by; and he
would step more boldly, and bustle aloud among the contents of
the shop, and imitate, with elaborate bravado, the movements of a
busy man at ease in his own house.</p>
<p>But he was now so pulled about by different alarms that, while
one portion of his mind was still alert and cunning, another
trembled on the brink of lunacy.&nbsp; One hallucination in
particular took a strong hold on his credulity.&nbsp; The
neighbour hearkening with white face beside his window, the
passer-by arrested by a horrible surmise on the
pavement&mdash;these could at worst suspect, they could not know;
through the brick walls and shuttered windows only sounds could
penetrate.&nbsp; But here, within the house, was he alone?&nbsp;
He knew he was; he had watched the servant set forth
sweet-hearting, in her poor best, &lsquo;out for the day&rsquo;
written in every ribbon and smile.&nbsp; Yes, he was alone, of
course; and yet, in the bulk of empty house above him, he could
surely hear a stir of delicate footing&mdash;he was surely
conscious, inexplicably conscious of some presence.&nbsp; Ay,
surely; to every room and corner of the house his imagination
followed it; and now it was a faceless thing, and yet had eyes to
see with; and again it was a shadow of himself; and yet again
behold the image of the dead dealer, reinspired with cunning and
hatred.</p>
<p>At times, with a strong effort, he would glance at the open
door which still seemed to repel his eyes.&nbsp; The house was
tall, the skylight small and dirty, the day blind with fog; and
the light that filtered down to the ground story was exceedingly
faint, and showed dimly on the threshold of the shop.&nbsp; And
yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness, did there not hang
wavering a shadow?</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the street outside, a very jovial gentleman
began to beat with a staff on the shop-door, accompanying his
blows with shouts and railleries in which the dealer was
continually called upon by name.&nbsp; Markheim, smitten into
ice, glanced at the dead man.&nbsp; But no! he lay quite still;
he was fled away far beyond earshot of these blows and shoutings;
he was sunk beneath seas of silence; and his name, which would
once have caught his notice above the howling of a storm, had
become an empty sound.&nbsp; And presently the jovial gentleman
desisted from his knocking, and departed.</p>
<p>Here was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be done, to
get forth from this accusing neighbourhood, to plunge into a bath
of London multitudes, and to reach, on the other side of day,
that haven of safety and apparent innocence&mdash;his bed.&nbsp;
One visitor had come: at any moment another might follow and be
more obstinate.&nbsp; To have done the deed, and yet not to reap
the profit, would be too abhorrent a failure.&nbsp; The money,
that was now Markheim&rsquo;s concern; and as a means to that,
the keys.</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the open door, where the
shadow was still lingering and shivering; and with no conscious
repugnance of the mind, yet with a tremor of the belly, he drew
near the body of his victim.&nbsp; The human character had quite
departed.&nbsp; Like a suit half-stuffed with bran, the limbs lay
scattered, the trunk doubled, on the floor; and yet the thing
repelled him.&nbsp; Although so dingy and inconsiderable to the
eye, he feared it might have more significance to the
touch.&nbsp; He took the body by the shoulders, and turned it on
its back.&nbsp; It was strangely light and supple, and the limbs,
as if they had been broken, fell into the oddest postures.&nbsp;
The face was robbed of all expression; but it was as pale as wax,
and shockingly smeared with blood about one temple.&nbsp; That
was, for Markheim, the one displeasing circumstance.&nbsp; It
carried him back, upon the instant, to a certain fair-day in a
fishers&rsquo; village: a gray day, a piping wind, a crowd upon
the street, the blare of brasses, the booming of drums, the nasal
voice of a ballad singer; and a boy going to and fro, buried over
head in the crowd and divided between interest and fear, until,
coming out upon the chief place of concourse, he beheld a booth
and a great screen with pictures, dismally designed, garishly
coloured: Brown-rigg with her apprentice; the Mannings with their
murdered guest; Weare in the death-grip of Thurtell; and a score
besides of famous crimes.&nbsp; The thing was as clear as an
illusion; he was once again that little boy; he was looking once
again, and with the same sense of physical revolt, at these vile
pictures; he was still stunned by the thumping of the
drums.&nbsp; A bar of that day&rsquo;s music returned upon his
memory; and at that, for the first time, a qualm came over him, a
breath of nausea, a sudden weakness of the joints, which he must
instantly resist and conquer.</p>
<p>He judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from these
considerations; looking the more hardily in the dead face,
bending his mind to realise the nature and greatness of his
crime.&nbsp; So little a while ago that face had moved with every
change of sentiment, that pale mouth had spoken, that body had
been all on fire with governable energies; and now, and by his
act, that piece of life had been arrested, as the horologist,
with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock.&nbsp;
So he reasoned in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful
consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before the
painted effigies of crime, looked on its reality unmoved.&nbsp;
At best, he felt a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in
vain with all those faculties that can make the world a garden of
enchantment, one who had never lived and who was now dead.&nbsp;
But of penitence, no, not a tremor.</p>
<p>With that, shaking himself clear of these considerations, he
found the keys and advanced towards the open door of the
shop.&nbsp; Outside, it had begun to rain smartly; and the sound
of the shower upon the roof had banished silence.&nbsp; Like some
dripping cavern, the chambers of the house were haunted by an
incessant echoing, which filled the ear and mingled with the
ticking of the clocks.&nbsp; And, as Markheim approached the
door, he seemed to hear, in answer to his own cautious tread, the
steps of another foot withdrawing up the stair.&nbsp; The shadow
still palpitated loosely on the threshold.&nbsp; He threw a
ton&rsquo;s weight of resolve upon his muscles, and drew back the
door.</p>
<p>The faint, foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare floor
and stairs; on the bright suit of armour posted, halbert in hand,
upon the landing; and on the dark wood-carvings, and framed
pictures that hung against the yellow panels of the
wainscot.&nbsp; So loud was the beating of the rain through all
the house that, in Markheim&rsquo;s ears, it began to be
distinguished into many different sounds.&nbsp; Footsteps and
sighs, the tread of regiments marching in the distance, the chink
of money in the counting, and the creaking of doors held
stealthily ajar, appeared to mingle with the patter of the drops
upon the cupola and the gushing of the water in the pipes.&nbsp;
The sense that he was not alone grew upon him to the verge of
madness.&nbsp; On every side he was haunted and begirt by
presences.&nbsp; He heard them moving in the upper chambers; from
the shop, he heard the dead man getting to his legs; and as he
began with a great effort to mount the stairs, feet fled quietly
before him and followed stealthily behind.&nbsp; If he were but
deaf, he thought, how tranquilly he would possess his soul!&nbsp;
And then again, and hearkening with ever fresh attention, he
blessed himself for that unresting sense which held the outposts
and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life.&nbsp; His head turned
continually on his neck; his eyes, which seemed starting from
their orbits, scouted on every side, and on every side were
half-rewarded as with the tail of something nameless
vanishing.&nbsp; The four-and-twenty steps to the first floor
were four-and-twenty agonies.</p>
<p>On that first storey, the doors stood ajar, three of them like
three ambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of
cannon.&nbsp; He could never again, he felt, be sufficiently
immured and fortified from men&rsquo;s observing eyes, he longed
to be home, girt in by walls, buried among bedclothes, and
invisible to all but God.&nbsp; And at that thought he wondered a
little, recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear they
were said to entertain of heavenly avengers.&nbsp; It was not so,
at least, with him.&nbsp; He feared the laws of nature, lest, in
their callous and immutable procedure, they should preserve some
damning evidence of his crime.&nbsp; He feared tenfold more, with
a slavish, superstitions terror, some scission in the continuity
of man&rsquo;s experience, some wilful illegality of
nature.&nbsp; He played a game of skill, depending on the rules,
calculating consequence from cause; and what if nature, as the
defeated tyrant overthrew the chess-board, should break the mould
of their succession?&nbsp; The like had befallen Napoleon (so
writers said) when the winter changed the time of its
appearance.&nbsp; The like might befall Markheim: the solid walls
might become transparent and reveal his doings like those of bees
in a glass hive; the stout planks might yield under his foot like
quicksands and detain him in their clutch; ay, and there were
soberer accidents that might destroy him: if, for instance, the
house should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim;
or the house next door should fly on fire, and the firemen invade
him from all sides.&nbsp; These things he feared; and, in a
sense, these things might be called the hands of God reached
forth against sin.&nbsp; But about God himself he was at ease;
his act was doubtless exceptional, but so were his excuses, which
God knew; it was there, and not among men, that he felt sure of
justice.</p>
<p>When he had got safe into the drawing-room, and shut the door
behind him, he was aware of a respite from alarms.&nbsp; The room
was quite dismantled, uncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing
cases and incongruous furniture; several great pier-glasses, in
which he beheld himself at various angles, like an actor on a
stage; many pictures, framed and unframed, standing, with their
faces to the wall; a fine Sheraton sideboard, a cabinet of
marquetry, and a great old bed, with tapestry hangings.&nbsp; The
windows opened to the floor; but by great good fortune the lower
part of the shutters had been closed, and this concealed him from
the neighbours.&nbsp; Here, then, Markheim drew in a packing case
before the cabinet, and began to search among the keys.&nbsp; It
was a long business, for there were many; and it was irksome,
besides; for, after all, there might be nothing in the cabinet,
and time was on the wing.&nbsp; But the closeness of the
occupation sobered him.&nbsp; With the tail of his eye he saw the
door&mdash;even glanced at it from time to time directly, like a
besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate of his
defences.&nbsp; But in truth he was at peace.&nbsp; The rain
falling in the street sounded natural and pleasant.&nbsp;
Presently, on the other side, the notes of a piano were wakened
to the music of a hymn, and the voices of many children took up
the air and words.&nbsp; How stately, how comfortable was the
melody!&nbsp; How fresh the youthful voices!&nbsp; Markheim gave
ear to it smilingly, as he sorted out the keys; and his mind was
thronged with answerable ideas and images; church-going children
and the pealing of the high organ; children afield, bathers by
the brookside, ramblers on the brambly common, kite-flyers in the
windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another cadence of
the hymn, back again to church, and the somnolence of summer
Sundays, and the high genteel voice of the parson (which he
smiled a little to recall) and the painted Jacobean tombs, and
the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments in the chancel.</p>
<p>And as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was startled
to his feet.&nbsp; A flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting
gush of blood, went over him, and then he stood transfixed and
thrilling.&nbsp; A step mounted the stair slowly and steadily,
and presently a hand was laid upon the knob, and the lock
clicked, and the door opened.</p>
<p>Fear held Markheim in a vice.&nbsp; What to expect he knew
not, whether the dead man walking, or the official ministers of
human justice, or some chance witness blindly stumbling in to
consign him to the gallows.&nbsp; But when a face was thrust into
the aperture, glanced round the room, looked at him, nodded and
smiled as if in friendly recognition, and then withdrew again,
and the door closed behind it, his fear broke loose from his
control in a hoarse cry.&nbsp; At the sound of this the visitant
returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you call me?&rsquo; he asked, pleasantly, and with
that he entered the room and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Markheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes.&nbsp;
Perhaps there was a film upon his sight, but the outlines of the
new comer seemed to change and waver like those of the idols in
the wavering candle-light of the shop; and at times he thought he
knew him; and at times he thought he bore a likeness to himself;
and always, like a lump of living terror, there lay in his bosom
the conviction that this thing was not of the earth and not of
God.</p>
<p>And yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace, as
he stood looking on Markheim with a smile; and when he added:
&lsquo;You are looking for the money, I believe?&rsquo; it was in
the tones of everyday politeness.</p>
<p>Markheim made no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should warn you,&rsquo; resumed the other,
&lsquo;that the maid has left her sweetheart earlier than usual
and will soon be here.&nbsp; If Mr. Markheim be found in this
house, I need not describe to him the consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know me?&rsquo; cried the murderer.</p>
<p>The visitor smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have long been a
favourite of mine,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I have long
observed and often sought to help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you?&rsquo; cried Markheim: &lsquo;the
devil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I may be,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;cannot
affect the service I propose to render you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can,&rsquo; cried Markheim; &lsquo;it does!&nbsp; Be
helped by you?&nbsp; No, never; not by you!&nbsp; You do not know
me yet; thank God, you do not know me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you,&rsquo; replied the visitant, with a sort of
kind severity or rather firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you to the
soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know me!&rsquo; cried Markheim.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who can do
so?&nbsp; My life is but a travesty and slander on myself.&nbsp;
I have lived to belie my nature.&nbsp; All men do; all men are
better than this disguise that grows about and stifles
them.&nbsp; You see each dragged away by life, like one whom
bravos have seized and muffled in a cloak.&nbsp; If they had
their own control&mdash;if you could see their faces, they would
be altogether different, they would shine out for heroes and
saints!&nbsp; I am worse than most; myself is more overlaid; my
excuse is known to me and God.&nbsp; But, had I the time, I could
disclose myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To me?&rsquo; inquired the visitant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To you before all,&rsquo; returned the murderer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I supposed you were intelligent.&nbsp; I
thought&mdash;since you exist&mdash;you would prove a reader of
the heart.&nbsp; And yet you would propose to judge me by my
acts!&nbsp; Think of it; my acts!&nbsp; I was born and I have
lived in a land of giants; giants have dragged me by the wrists
since I was born out of my mother&mdash;the giants of
circumstance.&nbsp; And you would judge me by my acts!&nbsp; But
can you not look within?&nbsp; Can you not understand that evil
is hateful to me?&nbsp; Can you not see within me the clear
writing of conscience, never blurred by any wilful sophistry,
although too often disregarded?&nbsp; Can you not read me for a
thing that surely must be common as humanity&mdash;the unwilling
sinner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this is very feelingly expressed,&rsquo; was the
reply, &lsquo;but it regards me not.&nbsp; These points of
consistency are beyond my province, and I care not in the least
by what compulsion you may have been dragged away, so as you are
but carried in the right direction.&nbsp; But time flies; the
servant delays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the
pictures on the hoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer; and
remember, it is as if the gallows itself was striding towards you
through the Christmas streets!&nbsp; Shall I help you; I, who
know all?&nbsp; Shall I tell you where to find the
money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For what price?&rsquo; asked Markheim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I offer you the service for a Christmas gift,&rsquo;
returned the other.</p>
<p>Markheim could not refrain from smiling with a kind of bitter
triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will take
nothing at your hands; if I were dying of thirst, and it was your
hand that put the pitcher to my lips, I should find the courage
to refuse.&nbsp; It may be credulous, but I will do nothing to
commit myself to evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no objection to a death-bed repentance,&rsquo;
observed the visitant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you disbelieve their efficacy!&rsquo; Markheim
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not say so,&rsquo; returned the other; &lsquo;but
I look on these things from a different side, and when the life
is done my interest falls.&nbsp; The man has lived to serve me,
to spread black looks under colour of religion, or to sow tares
in the wheat-field, as you do, in a course of weak compliance
with desire.&nbsp; Now that he draws so near to his deliverance,
he can add but one act of service&mdash;to repent, to die
smiling, and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more
timorous of my surviving followers.&nbsp; I am not so hard a
master.&nbsp; Try me.&nbsp; Accept my help.&nbsp; Please yourself
in life as you have done hitherto; please yourself more amply,
spread your elbows at the board; and when the night begins to
fall and the curtains to be drawn, I tell you, for your greater
comfort, that you will find it even easy to compound your quarrel
with your conscience, and to make a truckling peace with
God.&nbsp; I came but now from such a deathbed, and the room was
full of sincere mourners, listening to the man&rsquo;s last
words: and when I looked into that face, which had been set as a
flint against mercy, I found it smiling with hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you, then, suppose me such a creature?&rsquo;
asked Markheim.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think I have no more generous
aspirations than to sin, and sin, and sin, and, at the last,
sneak into heaven?&nbsp; My heart rises at the thought.&nbsp; Is
this, then, your experience of mankind? or is it because you find
me with red hands that you presume such baseness? and is this
crime of murder indeed so impious as to dry up the very springs
of good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Murder is to me no special category,&rsquo; replied the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;All sins are murder, even as all life is
war.&nbsp; I behold your race, like starving mariners on a raft,
plucking crusts out of the hands of famine and feeding on each
other&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; I follow sins beyond the moment of
their acting; I find in all that the last consequence is death;
and to my eyes, the pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such
taking graces on a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with
human gore than such a murderer as yourself.&nbsp; Do I say that
I follow sins?&nbsp; I follow virtues also; they differ not by
the thickness of a nail, they are both scythes for the reaping
angel of Death.&nbsp; Evil, for which I live, consists not in
action but in character.&nbsp; The bad man is dear to me; not the
bad act, whose fruits, if we could follow them far enough down
the hurtling cataract of the ages, might yet be found more
blessed than those of the rarest virtues.&nbsp; And it is not
because you have killed a dealer, but because you are Markheim,
that I offer to forward your escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will lay my heart open to you,&rsquo; answered
Markheim.&nbsp; &lsquo;This crime on which you find me is my
last.&nbsp; On my way to it I have learned many lessons; itself
is a lesson, a momentous lesson.&nbsp; Hitherto I have been
driven with revolt to what I would not; I was a bond-slave to
poverty, driven and scourged.&nbsp; There are robust virtues that
can stand in these temptations; mine was not so: I had a thirst
of pleasure.&nbsp; But to-day, and out of this deed, I pluck both
warning and riches&mdash;both the power and a fresh resolve to be
myself.&nbsp; I become in all things a free actor in the world; I
begin to see myself all changed, these hands the agents of good,
this heart at peace.&nbsp; Something comes over me out of the
past; something of what I have dreamed on Sabbath evenings to the
sound of the church organ, of what I forecast when I shed tears
over noble books, or talked, an innocent child, with my
mother.&nbsp; There lies my life; I have wandered a few years,
but now I see once more my city of destination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are to use this money on the Stock Exchange, I
think?&rsquo; remarked the visitor; &lsquo;and there, if I
mistake not, you have already lost some thousands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Markheim, &lsquo;but this time I have a
sure thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This time, again, you will lose,&rsquo; replied the
visitor quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but I keep back the half!&rsquo; cried
Markheim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That also you will lose,&rsquo; said the other.</p>
<p>The sweat started upon Markheim&rsquo;s brow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, then, what matter?&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Say it be lost, say I am plunged again in poverty, shall
one part of me, and that the worse, continue until the end to
override the better?&nbsp; Evil and good run strong in me, haling
me both ways.&nbsp; I do not love the one thing, I love
all.&nbsp; I can conceive great deeds, renunciations, martyrdoms;
and though I be fallen to such a crime as murder, pity is no
stranger to my thoughts.&nbsp; I pity the poor; who knows their
trials better than myself?&nbsp; I pity and help them; I prize
love, I love honest laughter; there is no good thing nor true
thing on earth but I love it from my heart.&nbsp; And are my
vices only to direct my life, and my virtues to lie without
effect, like some passive lumber of the mind?&nbsp; Not so; good,
also, is a spring of acts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the visitant raised his finger.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
six-and-thirty years that you have been in this world,&rsquo;
said be, &lsquo;through many changes of fortune and varieties of
humour, I have watched you steadily fall.&nbsp; Fifteen years ago
you would have started at a theft.&nbsp; Three years back you
would have blenched at the name of murder.&nbsp; Is there any
crime, is there any cruelty or meanness, from which you still
recoil?&mdash;five years from now I shall detect you in the
fact!&nbsp; Downward, downward, lies your way; nor can anything
but death avail to stop you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; Markheim said huskily, &lsquo;I have
in some degree complied with evil.&nbsp; But it is so with all:
the very saints, in the mere exercise of living, grow less
dainty, and take on the tone of their surroundings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will propound to you one simple question,&rsquo; said
the other; &lsquo;and as you answer, I shall read to you your
moral horoscope.&nbsp; You have grown in many things more lax;
possibly you do right to be so&mdash;and at any account, it is
the same with all men.&nbsp; But granting that, are you in any
one particular, however trifling, more difficult to please with
your own conduct, or do you go in all things with a looser
rein?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In any one?&rsquo; repeated Markheim, with an anguish
of consideration.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he added, with despair,
&lsquo;in none!&nbsp; I have gone down in all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the visitor, &lsquo;content yourself
with what you are, for you will never change; and the words of
your part on this stage are irrevocably written down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Markheim stood for a long while silent, and indeed it was the
visitor who first broke the silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;That being
so,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;shall I show you the money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And grace?&rsquo; cried Markheim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you not tried it?&rsquo; returned the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Two or three years ago, did I not see you on the platform
of revival meetings, and was not your voice the loudest in the
hymn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said Markheim; &lsquo;and I see
clearly what remains for me by way of duty.&nbsp; I thank you for
these lessons from my soul; my eyes are opened, and I behold
myself at last for what I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, the sharp note of the door-bell rang through
the house; and the visitant, as though this were some concerted
signal for which he had been waiting, changed at once in his
demeanour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The maid!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has
returned, as I forewarned you, and there is now before you one
more difficult passage.&nbsp; Her master, you must say, is ill;
you must let her in, with an assured but rather serious
countenance&mdash;no smiles, no overacting, and I promise you
success!&nbsp; Once the girl within, and the door closed, the
same dexterity that has already rid you of the dealer will
relieve you of this last danger in your path.&nbsp; Thenceforward
you have the whole evening&mdash;the whole night, if
needful&mdash;to ransack the treasures of the house and to make
good your safety.&nbsp; This is help that comes to you with the
mask of danger.&nbsp; Up!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;up, friend;
your life hangs trembling in the scales: up, and act!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Markheim steadily regarded his counsellor.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I
be condemned to evil acts,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there is still
one door of freedom open&mdash;I can cease from action.&nbsp; If
my life be an ill thing, I can lay it down.&nbsp; Though I be, as
you say truly, at the beck of every small temptation, I can yet,
by one decisive gesture, place myself beyond the reach of
all.&nbsp; My love of good is damned to barrenness; it may, and
let it be!&nbsp; But I have still my hatred of evil; and from
that, to your galling disappointment, you shall see that I can
draw both energy and courage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful and
lovely change: they brightened and softened with a tender
triumph, and, even as they brightened, faded and dislimned.&nbsp;
But Markheim did not pause to watch or understand the
transformation.&nbsp; He opened the door and went downstairs very
slowly, thinking to himself.&nbsp; His past went soberly before
him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like a dream,
random as chance-medley&mdash;a scene of defeat.&nbsp; Life, as
he thus reviewed it, tempted him no longer; but on the further
side he perceived a quiet haven for his bark.&nbsp; He paused in
the passage, and looked into the shop, where the candle still
burned by the dead body.&nbsp; It was strangely silent.&nbsp;
Thoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind, as he stood
gazing.&nbsp; And then the bell once more broke out into
impatient clamour.</p>
<p>He confronted the maid upon the threshold with something like
a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better go for the police,&rsquo; said he:
&lsquo;I have killed your master.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>THRAWN JANET</h2>
<p>The Reverend Murdoch Soulis was long minister of the moorland
parish of Balweary, in the vale of Dule.&nbsp; A severe,
bleak-faced old man, dreadful to his hearers, he dwelt in the
last years of his life, without relative or servant or any human
company, in the small and lonely manse under the Hanging
Shaw.&nbsp; In spite of the iron composure of his features, his
eye was wild, scared, and uncertain; and when he dwelt, in
private admonitions, on the future of the impenitent, it seemed
as if his eye pierced through the storms of time to the terrors
of eternity.&nbsp; Many young persons, coming to prepare
themselves against the season of the Holy Communion, were
dreadfully affected by his talk.&nbsp; He had a sermon on lst
Peter, v. and 8th, &lsquo;The devil as a roaring lion,&rsquo; on
the Sunday after every seventeenth of August, and he was
accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the
appalling nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in
the pulpit.&nbsp; The children were frightened into fits, and the
old looked more than usually oracular, and were, all that day,
full of those hints that Hamlet deprecated.&nbsp; The manse
itself, where it stood by the water of Dule among some thick
trees, with the Shaw overhanging it on the one side, and on the
other many cold, moorish hilltops rising towards the sky, had
begun, at a very early period of Mr. Soulis&rsquo;s ministry, to
be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued themselves upon
their prudence; and guidmen sitting at the clachan alehouse shook
their heads together at the thought of passing late by that
uncanny neighbourhood.&nbsp; There was one spot, to be more
particular, which was regarded with especial awe.&nbsp; The manse
stood between the high road and the water of Dule, with a gable
to each; its back was towards the kirk-town of Balweary, nearly
half a mile away; in front of it, a bare garden, hedged with
thorn, occupied the land between the river and the road.&nbsp;
The house was two stories high, with two large rooms on
each.&nbsp; It opened not directly on the garden, but on a
causewayed path, or passage, giving on the road on the one hand,
and closed on the other by the tall willows and elders that
bordered on the stream.&nbsp; And it was this strip of causeway
that enjoyed among the young parishioners of Balweary so infamous
a reputation.&nbsp; The minister walked there often after dark,
sometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers;
and when he was from home, and the manse door was locked, the
more daring schoolboys ventured, with beating hearts, to
&lsquo;follow my leader&rsquo; across that legendary spot.</p>
<p>This atmosphere of terror, surrounding, as it did, a man of
God of spotless character and orthodoxy, was a common cause of
wonder and subject of inquiry among the few strangers who were
led by chance or business into that unknown, outlying
country.&nbsp; But many even of the people of the parish were
ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of
Mr. Soulis&rsquo;s ministrations; and among those who were better
informed, some were naturally reticent, and others shy of that
particular topic.&nbsp; Now and again, only, one of the older
folk would warm into courage over his third tumbler, and recount
the cause of the minister&rsquo;s strange looks and solitary
life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Fifty years syne, when Mr. Soulis cam first into
Ba&rsquo;weary, he was still a young man&mdash;a callant, the
folk said&mdash;fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; book learnin&rsquo; and grand
at the exposition, but, as was natural in sae young a man,
wi&rsquo; nae leevin&rsquo; experience in religion.&nbsp; The
younger sort were greatly taken wi&rsquo; his gifts and his gab;
but auld, concerned, serious men and women were moved even to
prayer for the young man, whom they took to be a self-deceiver,
and the parish that was like to be sae ill-supplied.&nbsp; It was
before the days o&rsquo; the moderates&mdash;weary fa&rsquo;
them; but ill things are like guid&mdash;they baith come bit by
bit, a pickle at a time; and there were folk even then that said
the Lord had left the college professors to their ain devices,
an&rsquo; the lads that went to study wi&rsquo; them wad hae done
mair and better sittin&rsquo; in a peat-bog, like their forbears
of the persecution, wi&rsquo; a Bible under their oxter and a
speerit o&rsquo; prayer in their heart.&nbsp; There was nae
doubt, onyway, but that Mr. Soulis had been ower lang at the
college.&nbsp; He was careful and troubled for mony things
besides the ae thing needful.&nbsp; He had a feck o&rsquo; books
wi&rsquo; him&mdash;mair than had ever been seen before in
a&rsquo; that presbytery; and a sair wark the carrier had
wi&rsquo; them, for they were a&rsquo; like to have smoored in
the Deil&rsquo;s Hag between this and Kilmackerlie.&nbsp; They
were books o&rsquo; divinity, to be sure, or so they ca&rsquo;d
them; but the serious were o&rsquo; opinion there was little
service for sae mony, when the hail o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s Word
would gang in the neuk of a plaid.&nbsp; Then he wad sit half the
day and half the nicht forbye, which was scant
decent&mdash;writin&rsquo;, nae less; and first, they were feared
he wad read his sermons; and syne it proved he was writin&rsquo;
a book himsel&rsquo;, which was surely no fittin&rsquo; for ane
of his years an&rsquo; sma&rsquo; experience.</p>
<p>Onyway it behoved him to get an auld, decent wife to keep the
manse for him an&rsquo; see to his bit denners; and he was
recommended to an auld limmer&mdash;Janet M&rsquo;Clour, they
ca&rsquo;d her&mdash;and sae far left to himsel&rsquo; as to be
ower persuaded.&nbsp; There was mony advised him to the contrar,
for Janet was mair than suspeckit by the best folk in
Ba&rsquo;weary.&nbsp; Lang or that, she had had a wean to a
dragoon; she hadnae come forrit <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a> for maybe thretty
year; and bairns had seen her mumblin&rsquo; to hersel&rsquo; up
on Key&rsquo;s Loan in the gloamin&rsquo;, whilk was an unco time
an&rsquo; place for a God-fearin&rsquo; woman.&nbsp; Howsoever,
it was the laird himsel&rsquo; that had first tauld the minister
o&rsquo; Janet; and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to
pleesure the laird.&nbsp; When folk tauld him that Janet was sib
to the deil, it was a&rsquo; superstition by his way of it;
an&rsquo; when they cast up the Bible to him an&rsquo; the witch
of Endor, he wad threep it doun their thrapples that thir days
were a&rsquo; gane by, and the deil was mercifully
restrained.</p>
<p>Weel, when it got about the clachan that Janet M&rsquo;Clour
was to be servant at the manse, the folk were fair mad wi&rsquo;
her an&rsquo; him thegether; and some o&rsquo; the guidwives had
nae better to dae than get round her door cheeks and chairge her
wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; that was ken&rsquo;t again her, frae the
sodger&rsquo;s bairn to John Tamson&rsquo;s twa kye.&nbsp; She
was nae great speaker; folk usually let her gang her ain gate,
an&rsquo; she let them gang theirs, wi&rsquo;, neither
Fair-guid-een nor Fair-guid-day; but when she buckled to, she had
a tongue to deave the miller.&nbsp; Up she got, an&rsquo; there
wasnae an auld story in Ba&rsquo;weary but she gart somebody lowp
for it that day; they couldnae say ae thing but she could say twa
to it; till, at the hinder end, the guidwives up and claught haud
of her, and clawed the coats aff her back, and pu&rsquo;d her
doun the clachan to the water o&rsquo; Dule, to see if she were a
witch or no, soum or droun.&nbsp; The carline skirled till ye
could hear her at the Hangin&rsquo; Shaw, and she focht like ten;
there was mony a guidwife bure the mark of her neist day
an&rsquo; mony a lang day after; and just in the hettest o&rsquo;
the collieshangie, wha suld come up (for his sins) but the new
minister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Women,&rsquo; said he (and he had a grand voice),
&lsquo;I charge you in the Lord&rsquo;s name to let her
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Janet ran to him&mdash;she was fair wud wi&rsquo;
terror&mdash;an&rsquo; clang to him, an&rsquo; prayed him, for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, save her frae the cummers; an&rsquo; they,
for their pairt, tauld him a&rsquo; that was ken&rsquo;t, and
maybe mair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Woman,&rsquo; says he to Janet, &lsquo;is this
true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the Lord sees me,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;as the
Lord made me, no a word o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Forbye the bairn,&rsquo;
says she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a decent woman a&rsquo; my
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you,&rsquo; says Mr. Soulis, &lsquo;in the name of
God, and before me, His unworthy minister, renounce the devil and
his works?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Weel, it wad appear that when he askit that, she gave a girn
that fairly frichtit them that saw her, an&rsquo; they could hear
her teeth play dirl thegether in her chafts; but there was
naething for it but the ae way or the ither; an&rsquo; Janet
lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before them
a&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; says Mr. Soulis to the guidwives,
&lsquo;home with ye, one and all, and pray to God for His
forgiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he gied Janet his arm, though she had little on her but a
sark, and took her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy of
the land; an&rsquo; her scrieghin&rsquo; and laughin&rsquo; as
was a scandal to be heard.</p>
<p>There were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht;
but when the morn cam&rsquo; there was sic a fear fell upon
a&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary that the bairns hid theirsels, and even
the men folk stood and keekit frae their doors.&nbsp; For there
was Janet comin&rsquo; doun the clachan&mdash;her or her
likeness, nane could tell&mdash;wi&rsquo; her neck thrawn, and
her heid on ae side, like a body that has been hangit, and a girn
on her face like an unstreakit corp.&nbsp; By an&rsquo; by they
got used wi&rsquo; it, and even speered at her to ken what was
wrang; but frae that day forth she couldnae speak like a
Christian woman, but slavered and played click wi&rsquo; her
teeth like a pair o&rsquo; shears; and frae that day forth the
name o&rsquo; God cam never on her lips.&nbsp; Whiles she wad try
to say it, but it michtnae be.&nbsp; Them that kenned best said
least; but they never gied that Thing the name o&rsquo; Janet
M&rsquo;Clour; for the auld Janet, by their way o&rsquo;t, was in
muckle hell that day.&nbsp; But the minister was neither to haud
nor to bind; he preached about naething but the folk&rsquo;s
cruelty that had gi&rsquo;en her a stroke of the palsy; he skelpt
the bairns that meddled her; and he had her up to the manse that
same nicht, and dwalled there a&rsquo; his lane wi&rsquo; her
under the Hangin&rsquo; Shaw.</p>
<p>Weel, time gaed by: and the idler sort commenced to think mair
lichtly o&rsquo; that black business.&nbsp; The minister was weel
thocht o&rsquo;; he was aye late at the writing, folk wad see his
can&rsquo;le doon by the Dule water after twal&rsquo; at
e&rsquo;en; and he seemed pleased wi&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; and
upsitten as at first, though a&rsquo; body could see that he was
dwining.&nbsp; As for Janet she cam an&rsquo; she gaed; if she
didnae speak muckle afore, it was reason she should speak less
then; she meddled naebody; but she was an eldritch thing to see,
an&rsquo; nane wad hae mistrysted wi&rsquo; her for
Ba&rsquo;weary glebe.</p>
<p>About the end o&rsquo; July there cam&rsquo; a spell o&rsquo;
weather, the like o&rsquo;t never was in that country side; it
was lown an&rsquo; het an&rsquo; heartless; the herds couldnae
win up the Black Hill, the bairns were ower weariet to play;
an&rsquo; yet it was gousty too, wi&rsquo; claps o&rsquo; het
wund that rumm&rsquo;led in the glens, and bits o&rsquo; shouers
that slockened naething.&nbsp; We aye thocht it but to
thun&rsquo;er on the morn; but the morn cam, an&rsquo; the
morn&rsquo;s morning, and it was aye the same uncanny weather,
sair on folks and bestial.&nbsp; Of a&rsquo; that were the waur,
nane suffered like Mr. Soulis; he could neither sleep nor eat, he
tauld his elders; an&rsquo; when he wasnae writin&rsquo; at his
weary book, he wad be stravaguin&rsquo; ower a&rsquo; the
countryside like a man possessed, when a&rsquo; body else was
blythe to keep caller ben the house.</p>
<p>Abune Hangin&rsquo; Shaw, in the bield o&rsquo; the Black
Hill, there&rsquo;s a bit enclosed grund wi&rsquo; an iron yett;
and it seems, in the auld days, that was the kirkyaird o&rsquo;
Ba&rsquo;weary, and consecrated by the Papists before the blessed
licht shone upon the kingdom.&nbsp; It was a great howff o&rsquo;
Mr. Soulis&rsquo;s, onyway; there he would sit an&rsquo; consider
his sermons; and indeed it&rsquo;s a bieldy bit.&nbsp; Weel, as
he cam ower the wast end o&rsquo; the Black Hill, ae day, he saw
first twa, an syne fower, an&rsquo; syne seeven corbie craws
fleein&rsquo; round an&rsquo; round abune the auld
kirkyaird.&nbsp; They flew laigh and heavy, an&rsquo; squawked to
ither as they gaed; and it was clear to Mr. Soulis that something
had put them frae their ordinar.&nbsp; He wasnae easy fleyed,
an&rsquo; gaed straucht up to the wa&rsquo;s; an&rsquo; what suld
he find there but a man, or the appearance of a man,
sittin&rsquo; in the inside upon a grave.&nbsp; He was of a great
stature, an&rsquo; black as hell, and his e&rsquo;en were
singular to see. <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Soulis had heard tell
o&rsquo; black men, mony&rsquo;s the time; but there was
something unco about this black man that daunted him.&nbsp; Het
as he was, he took a kind o&rsquo; cauld grue in the marrow
o&rsquo; his banes; but up he spak for a&rsquo; that; an&rsquo;
says he: &lsquo;My friend, are you a stranger in this
place?&rsquo;&nbsp; The black man answered never a word; he got
upon his feet, an&rsquo; begude to hirsle to the wa&rsquo; on the
far side; but he aye lookit at the minister; an&rsquo; the
minister stood an&rsquo; lookit back; till a&rsquo; in a meenute
the black man was ower the wa&rsquo; an&rsquo; rinnin&rsquo; for
the bield o&rsquo; the trees.&nbsp; Mr. Soulis, he hardly kenned
why, ran after him; but he was sair forjaskit wi&rsquo; his walk
an&rsquo; the het, unhalesome weather; and rin as he likit, he
got nae mair than a glisk o&rsquo; the black man amang the birks,
till he won doun to the foot o&rsquo; the hill-side, an&rsquo;
there he saw him ance mair, gaun, hap, step, an&rsquo; lowp, ower
Dule water to the manse.</p>
<p>Mr. Soulis wasnae weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld
mak&rsquo; sae free wi&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary manse; an&rsquo; he
ran the harder, an&rsquo;, wet shoon, ower the burn, an&rsquo; up
the walk; but the deil a black man was there to see.&nbsp; He
stepped out upon the road, but there was naebody there; he gaed
a&rsquo; ower the gairden, but na, nae black man.&nbsp; At the
hinder end, and a bit feared as was but natural, he lifted the
hasp and into the manse; and there was Janet M&rsquo;Clour before
his een, wi&rsquo; her thrawn craig, and nane sae pleased to see
him.&nbsp; And he aye minded sinsyne, when first he set his een
upon her, he had the same cauld and deidly grue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Janet,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;have you seen a black
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A black man?&rsquo; quo&rsquo; she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Save
us a&rsquo;!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re no wise, minister.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nae black man in a Ba&rsquo;weary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she didnae speak plain, ye maun understand; but
yam-yammered, like a powney wi&rsquo; the bit in its moo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Janet, if there was nae
black man, I have spoken with the Accuser of the
Brethren.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he sat down like ane wi&rsquo; a fever, an&rsquo; his
teeth chittered in his heid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoots,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;think shame to
yoursel&rsquo;, minister;&rsquo; an&rsquo; gied him a drap brandy
that she keept aye by her.</p>
<p>Syne Mr. Soulis gaed into his study amang a&rsquo; his
books.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lang, laigh, mirk chalmer,
perishin&rsquo; cauld in winter, an&rsquo; no very dry even in
the tap o&rsquo; the simmer, for the manse stands near the
burn.&nbsp; Sae doun he sat, and thocht of a&rsquo; that had come
an&rsquo; gane since he was in Ba&rsquo;weary, an&rsquo; his
hame, an&rsquo; the days when he was a bairn an&rsquo; ran
daffin&rsquo; on the braes; and that black man aye ran in his
heid like the ower-come of a sang.&nbsp; Aye the mair he thocht,
the mair he thocht o&rsquo; the black man.&nbsp; He tried the
prayer, an&rsquo; the words wouldnae come to him; an&rsquo; he
tried, they say, to write at his book, but he could nae
mak&rsquo; nae mair o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; There was whiles he
thocht the black man was at his oxter, an&rsquo; the swat stood
upon him cauld as well-water; and there was other whiles, when he
cam to himsel&rsquo; like a christened bairn and minded
naething.</p>
<p>The upshot was that he gaed to the window an&rsquo; stood
glowrin&rsquo; at Dule water.&nbsp; The trees are unco thick,
an&rsquo; the water lies deep an&rsquo; black under the manse;
an&rsquo; there was Janct washin&rsquo; the cla&rsquo;es
wi&rsquo; her coats kilted.&nbsp; She had her back to the
minister, an&rsquo; he, for his pairt, hardly kenned what he was
lookin&rsquo; at.&nbsp; Syne she turned round, an&rsquo; shawed
her face; Mr. Soulis had the same cauld grue as twice that day
afore, an&rsquo; it was borne in upon him what folk said, that
Janet was deid lang syne, an&rsquo; this was a bogle in her
clay-cauld flesh.&nbsp; He drew back a pickle and he scanned her
narrowly.&nbsp; She was tramp-trampin&rsquo; in the cla&rsquo;es,
croonin&rsquo; to hersel&rsquo;; and eh!&nbsp; Gude guide us, but
it was a fearsome face.&nbsp; Whiles she sang louder, but there
was nae man born o&rsquo; woman that could tell the words
o&rsquo; her sang; an&rsquo; whiles she lookit side-lang doun,
but there was naething there for her to look at.&nbsp; There gaed
a scunner through the flesh upon his banes; and that was
Heeven&rsquo;s advertisement.&nbsp; But Mr. Soulis just blamed
himsel&rsquo;, he said, to think sae ill of a puir, auld
afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forbye himsel&rsquo;;
an&rsquo; he put up a bit prayer for him and her, an&rsquo; drank
a little caller water&mdash;for his heart rose again the
meat&mdash;an&rsquo; gaed up to his naked bed in the
gloaming.</p>
<p>That was a nicht that has never been forgotten in
Ba&rsquo;weary, the nicht o&rsquo; the seeventeenth of August,
seventeen hun&rsquo;er&rsquo; an twal&rsquo;.&nbsp; It had been
het afore, as I hae said, but that nicht it was hetter than
ever.&nbsp; The sun gaed doun amang unco-lookin&rsquo; clouds; it
fell as mirk as the pit; no a star, no a breath o&rsquo; wund; ye
couldnae see your han&rsquo; afore your face, and even the auld
folk cuist the covers frae their beds and lay pechin&rsquo; for
their breath.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; that he had upon his mind,
it was gey and unlikely Mr. Soulis wad get muckle sleep.&nbsp; He
lay an&rsquo; he tummled; the gude, caller bed that he got into
brunt his very banes; whiles he slept, and whiles he waukened;
whiles he heard the time o&rsquo; nicht, and whiles a tyke
yowlin&rsquo; up the muir, as if somebody was deid; whiles he
thocht he heard bogles claverin&rsquo; in his lug, an&rsquo;
whiles he saw spunkies in the room.&nbsp; He behoved, he judged,
to be sick; an&rsquo; sick he was&mdash;little he jaloosed the
sickness.</p>
<p>At the hinder end, he got a clearness in his mind, sat up in
his sark on the bed-side, and fell thinkin&rsquo; ance mair
o&rsquo; the black man an&rsquo; Janet.&nbsp; He couldnae weel
tell how&mdash;maybe it was the cauld to his feet&mdash;but it
cam&rsquo; in upon him wi&rsquo; a spate that there was some
connection between thir twa, an&rsquo; that either or baith
o&rsquo; them were bogles.&nbsp; And just at that moment, in
Janet&rsquo;s room, which was neist to his, there cam&rsquo; a
stramp o&rsquo; feet as if men were wars&rsquo;lin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; then a loud bang; an&rsquo; then a wund gaed reishling
round the fower quarters of the house; an&rsquo; then a&rsquo;
was aince mair as seelent as the grave.</p>
<p>Mr. Soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil.&nbsp; He got
his tinder-box, an&rsquo; lit a can&rsquo;le, an&rsquo; made
three steps o&rsquo;t ower to Janet&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; It was on
the hasp, an&rsquo; he pushed it open, an&rsquo; keeked bauldly
in.&nbsp; It was a big room, as big as the minister&rsquo;s ain,
an&rsquo; plenished wi&rsquo; grand, auld, solid gear, for he had
naething else.&nbsp; There was a fower-posted bed wi&rsquo; auld
tapestry; and a braw cabinet of aik, that was fu&rsquo; o&rsquo;
the minister&rsquo;s divinity books, an&rsquo; put there to be
out o&rsquo; the gate; an&rsquo; a wheen duds o&rsquo;
Janet&rsquo;s lying here and there about the floor.&nbsp; But nae
Janet could Mr. Soulis see; nor ony sign of a contention.&nbsp;
In he gaed (an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s few that wad ha&rsquo;e
followed him) an&rsquo; lookit a&rsquo; round, an&rsquo;
listened.&nbsp; But there was naethin&rsquo; to be heard, neither
inside the manse nor in a&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary parish, an&rsquo;
naethin&rsquo; to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin&rsquo;
round the can&rsquo;le.&nbsp; An&rsquo; then a&rsquo; at aince,
the minister&rsquo;s heart played dunt an&rsquo; stood
stock-still; an&rsquo; a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o&rsquo;
his heid.&nbsp; Whaten a weary sicht was that for the puir
man&rsquo;s een!&nbsp; For there was Janat hangin&rsquo; frae a
nail beside the auld aik cabinet: her heid aye lay on her
shoother, her een were steeked, the tongue projekit frae her
mouth, and her heels were twa feet clear abune the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forgive us all!&rsquo; thocht Mr. Soulis;
&lsquo;poor Janet&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He cam&rsquo; a step nearer to the corp; an&rsquo; then his
heart fair whammled in his inside.&nbsp; For by what cantrip it
wad ill-beseem a man to judge, she was hingin&rsquo; frae a
single nail an&rsquo; by a single wursted thread for
darnin&rsquo; hose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; thing to be your lane at nicht
wi&rsquo; siccan prodigies o&rsquo; darkness; but Mr. Soulis was
strong in the Lord.&nbsp; He turned an&rsquo; gaed his ways oot
o&rsquo; that room, and lockit the door ahint him; and step by
step, doon the stairs, as heavy as leed; and set doon the
can&rsquo;le on the table at the stairfoot.&nbsp; He couldnae
pray, he couldnae think, he was dreepin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
caul&rsquo; swat, an&rsquo; naething could he hear but the
dunt-dunt-duntin&rsquo; o&rsquo; his ain heart.&nbsp; He micht
maybe have stood there an hour, or maybe twa, he minded sae
little; when a&rsquo; o&rsquo; a sudden, he heard a laigh,
uncanny steer upstairs; a foot gaed to an&rsquo; fro in the
cha&rsquo;mer whaur the corp was hingin&rsquo;; syne the door was
opened, though he minded weel that he had lockit it; an&rsquo;
syne there was a step upon the landin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it seemed
to him as if the corp was lookin&rsquo; ower the rail and doun
upon him whaur he stood.</p>
<p>He took up the can&rsquo;le again (for he couldnae want the
licht), and as saftly as ever he could, gaed straucht out
o&rsquo; the manse an&rsquo; to the far end o&rsquo; the
causeway.&nbsp; It was aye pit-mirk; the flame o&rsquo; the
can&rsquo;le, when he set it on the grund, brunt steedy and clear
as in a room; naething moved, but the Dule water seepin&rsquo;
and sabbin&rsquo; doon the glen, an&rsquo; yon unhaly footstep
that cam&rsquo; ploddin doun the stairs inside the manse.&nbsp;
He kenned the foot over weel, for it was Janet&rsquo;s; and at
ilka step that cam&rsquo; a wee thing nearer, the cauld got
deeper in his vitals.&nbsp; He commanded his soul to Him that
made an&rsquo; keepit him; &lsquo;and O Lord,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;give me strength this night to war against the powers of
evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the foot was comin&rsquo; through the passage for
the door; he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa&rsquo;, as if
the fearsome thing was feelin&rsquo; for its way.&nbsp; The
saughs tossed an&rsquo; maned thegether, a lang sigh cam&rsquo;
ower the hills, the flame o&rsquo; the can&rsquo;le was blawn
aboot; an&rsquo; there stood the corp of Thrawn Janet, wi&rsquo;
her grogram goun an&rsquo; her black mutch, wi&rsquo; the heid
aye upon the shouther, an&rsquo; the girn still upon the face
o&rsquo;t&mdash;leevin&rsquo;, ye wad hae said&mdash;deid, as Mr.
Soulis weel kenned&mdash;upon the threshold o&rsquo; the
manse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange thing that the saul of man should be that
thirled into his perishable body; but the minister saw that,
an&rsquo; his heart didnae break.</p>
<p>She didnae stand there lang; she began to move again an&rsquo;
cam&rsquo; slowly towards Mr. Soulis whaur he stood under the
saughs.&nbsp; A&rsquo; the life o&rsquo; his body, a&rsquo; the
strength o&rsquo; his speerit, were glowerin&rsquo; frae his
een.&nbsp; It seemed she was gaun to speak, but wanted words,
an&rsquo; made a sign wi&rsquo; the left hand.&nbsp; There
cam&rsquo; a clap o&rsquo; wund, like a cat&rsquo;s fuff; oot
gaed the can&rsquo;le, the saughs skrieghed like folk; an&rsquo;
Mr. Soulis kenned that, live or die, this was the end
o&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Witch, beldame, devil!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I charge
you, by the power of God, begone&mdash;if you be dead, to the
grave&mdash;if you be damned, to hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An&rsquo; at that moment the Lord&rsquo;s ain hand out
o&rsquo; the Heevens struck the Horror whaur it stood; the auld,
deid, desecrated corp o&rsquo; the witch-wife, sae lang keepit
frae the grave and hirsled round by deils, lowed up like a
brunstane spunk and fell in ashes to the grund; the thunder
followed, peal on dirling peal, the rairing rain upon the back
o&rsquo; that; and Mr. Soulis lowped through the garden hedge,
and ran, wi&rsquo; skelloch upon skelloch, for the clachan.</p>
<p>That same mornin&rsquo;, John Christie saw the Black Man pass
the Muckle Cairn as it was chappin&rsquo; six; before eicht, he
gaed by the change-house at Knockdow; an&rsquo; no lang after,
Sandy M&rsquo;Lellan saw him gaun linkin&rsquo; doun the braes
frae Kilmackerlie.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little doubt but it was
him that dwalled sae lang in Janet&rsquo;s body; but he was
awa&rsquo; at last; and sinsyne the deil has never fashed us in
Ba&rsquo;weary.</p>
<p>But it was a sair dispensation for the minister; lang, lang he
lay ravin&rsquo; in his bed; and frae that hour to this, he was
the man ye ken the day.</p>
<h2>OLALLA</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;my part is done,
and, I may say, with some vanity, well done.&nbsp; It remains
only to get you out of this cold and poisonous city, and to give
you two months of a pure air and an easy conscience.&nbsp; The
last is your affair.&nbsp; To the first I think I can help
you.&nbsp; It fells indeed rather oddly; it was but the other day
the Padre came in from the country; and as he and I are old
friends, although of contrary professions, he applied to me in a
matter of distress among some of his parishioners.&nbsp; This was
a family&mdash;but you are ignorant of Spain, and even the names
of our grandees are hardly known to you; suffice it, then, that
they were once great people, and are now fallen to the brink of
destitution.&nbsp; Nothing now belongs to them but the
residencia, and certain leagues of desert mountain, in the
greater part of which not even a goat could support life.&nbsp;
But the house is a fine old place, and stands at a great height
among the hills, and most salubriously; and I had no sooner heard
my friend&rsquo;s tale, than I remembered you.&nbsp; I told him I
had a wounded officer, wounded in the good cause, who was now
able to make a change; and I proposed that his friends should
take you for a lodger.&nbsp; Instantly the Padre&rsquo;s face
grew dark, as I had maliciously foreseen it would.&nbsp; It was
out of the question, he said.&nbsp; Then let them starve, said I,
for I have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride.&nbsp;
There-upon we separated, not very content with one another; but
yesterday, to my wonder, the Padre returned and made a
submission: the difficulty, he said, he had found upon enquiry to
be less than he had feared; or, in other words, these proud
people had put their pride in their pocket.&nbsp; I closed with
the offer; and, subject to your approval, I have taken rooms for
you in the residencia.&nbsp; The air of these mountains will
renew your blood; and the quiet in which you will there live is
worth all the medicines in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you have been throughout
my good angel, and your advice is a command.&nbsp; But tell me,
if you please, something of the family with which I am to
reside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am coming to that,&rsquo; replied my friend;
&lsquo;and, indeed, there is a difficulty in the way.&nbsp; These
beggars are, as I have said, of very high descent and swollen
with the most baseless vanity; they have lived for some
generations in a growing isolation, drawing away, on either hand,
from the rich who had now become too high for them, and from the
poor, whom they still regarded as too low; and even to-day, when
poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest, they
cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation.&nbsp; You are
to remain, they say, a stranger; they will give you attendance,
but they refuse from the first the idea of the smallest
intimacy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I will not deny that I was piqued, and perhaps the feeling
strengthened my desire to go, for I was confident that I could
break down that barrier if I desired.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is
nothing offensive in such a stipulation,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;and I even sympathise with the feeling that inspired
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true they have never seen you,&rsquo; returned
the doctor politely; &lsquo;and if they knew you were the
handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever came from England
(where I am told that handsome men are common, but pleasant ones
not so much so), they would doubtless make you welcome with a
better grace.&nbsp; But since you take the thing so well, it
matters not.&nbsp; To me, indeed, it seems discourteous.&nbsp;
But you will find yourself the gainer.&nbsp; The family will not
much tempt you.&nbsp; A mother, a son, and a daughter; an old
woman said to be halfwitted, a country lout, and a country girl,
who stands very high with her confessor, and is,
therefore,&rsquo; chuckled the physician, &lsquo;most likely
plain; there is not much in that to attract the fancy of a
dashing officer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet you say they are high-born,&rsquo; I
objected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as to that, I should distinguish,&rsquo; returned
the doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;The mother is; not so the
children.&nbsp; The mother was the last representative of a
princely stock, degenerate both in parts and fortune.&nbsp; Her
father was not only poor, he was mad: and the girl ran wild about
the residencia till his death.&nbsp; Then, much of the fortune
having died with him, and the family being quite extinct, the
girl ran wilder than ever, until at last she married, Heaven
knows whom, a muleteer some say, others a smuggler; while there
are some who uphold there was no marriage at all, and that Felipe
and Olalla are bastards.&nbsp; The union, such as it was, was
tragically dissolved some years ago; but they live in such
seclusion, and the country at that time was in so much disorder,
that the precise manner of the man&rsquo;s end is known only to
the priest&mdash;if even to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I begin to think I shall have strange
experiences,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not romance, if I were you,&rsquo; replied the
doctor; &lsquo;you will find, I fear, a very grovelling and
commonplace reality.&nbsp; Felipe, for instance, I have
seen.&nbsp; And what am I to say?&nbsp; He is very rustic, very
cunning, very loutish, and, I should say, an innocent; the others
are probably to match.&nbsp; No, no, senor commandante, you must
seek congenial society among the great sights of our mountains;
and in these at least, if you are at all a lover of the works of
nature, I promise you will not be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next day Felipe came for me in a rough country cart, drawn
by a mule; and a little before the stroke of noon, after I had
said farewell to the doctor, the innkeeper, and different good
souls who had befriended me during my sickness, we set forth out
of the city by the Eastern gate, and began to ascend into the
Sierra.&nbsp; I had been so long a prisoner, since I was left
behind for dying after the loss of the convoy, that the mere
smell of the earth set me smiling.&nbsp; The country through
which we went was wild and rocky, partially covered with rough
woods, now of the cork-tree, and now of the great Spanish
chestnut, and frequently intersected by the beds of mountain
torrents.&nbsp; The sun shone, the wind rustled joyously; and we
had advanced some miles, and the city had already shrunk into an
inconsiderable knoll upon the plain behind us, before my
attention began to be diverted to the companion of my
drive.&nbsp; To the eye, he seemed but a diminutive, loutish,
well-made country lad, such as the doctor had described, mighty
quick and active, but devoid of any culture; and this first
impression was with most observers final.&nbsp; What began to
strike me was his familiar, chattering talk; so strangely
inconsistent with the terms on which I was to be received; and
partly from his imperfect enunciation, partly from the sprightly
incoherence of the matter, so very difficult to follow clearly
without an effort of the mind.&nbsp; It is true I had before
talked with persons of a similar mental constitution; persons who
seemed to live (as he did) by the senses, taken and possessed by
the visual object of the moment and unable to discharge their
minds of that impression.&nbsp; His seemed to me (as I sat,
distantly giving ear) a kind of conversation proper to drivers,
who pass much of their time in a great vacancy of the intellect
and threading the sights of a familiar country.&nbsp; But this
was not the case of Felipe; by his own account, he was a
home-keeper; &lsquo;I wish I was there now,&rsquo; he said; and
then, spying a tree by the wayside, he broke off to tell me that
he had once seen a crow among its branches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A crow?&rsquo; I repeated, struck by the ineptitude of
the remark, and thinking I had heard imperfectly.</p>
<p>But by this time he was already filled with a new idea;
hearkening with a rapt intentness, his head on one side, his face
puckered; and he struck me rudely, to make me hold my
peace.&nbsp; Then he smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you hear?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is all right,&rsquo; he said; and began
encouraging his mule with cries that echoed unhumanly up the
mountain walls.</p>
<p>I looked at him more closely.&nbsp; He was superlatively
well-built, light, and lithe and strong; he was well-featured;
his yellow eyes were very large, though, perhaps, not very
expressive; take him altogether, he was a pleasant-looking lad,
and I had no fault to find with him, beyond that he was of a
dusky hue, and inclined to hairyness; two characteristics that I
disliked.&nbsp; It was his mind that puzzled, and yet attracted
me.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;an innocent&mdash;came
back to me; and I was wondering if that were, after all, the true
description, when the road began to go down into the narrow and
naked chasm of a torrent.&nbsp; The waters thundered tumultuously
in the bottom; and the ravine was filled full of the sound, the
thin spray, and the claps of wind, that accompanied their
descent.&nbsp; The scene was certainly impressive; but the road
was in that part very securely walled in; the mule went steadily
forward; and I was astonished to perceive the paleness of terror
in the face of my companion.&nbsp; The voice of that wild river
was inconstant, now sinking lower as if in weariness, now
doubling its hoarse tones; momentary freshets seemed to swell its
volume, sweeping down the gorge, raving and booming against the
barrier walls; and I observed it was at each of these accessions
to the clamour, that my driver more particularly winced and
blanched.&nbsp; Some thoughts of Scottish superstition and the
river Kelpie, passed across my mind; I wondered if perchance the
like were prevalent in that part of Spain; and turning to Felipe,
sought to draw him out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I am afraid,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of what are you afraid?&rsquo; I returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This seems one of the safest places on this very dangerous
road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes a noise,&rsquo; he said, with a simplicity of
awe that set my doubts at rest.</p>
<p>The lad was but a child in intellect; his mind was like his
body, active and swift, but stunted in development; and I began
from that time forth to regard him with a measure of pity, and to
listen at first with indulgence, and at last even with pleasure,
to his disjointed babble.</p>
<p>By about four in the afternoon we had crossed the summit of
the mountain line, said farewell to the western sunshine, and
began to go down upon the other side, skirting the edge of many
ravines and moving through the shadow of dusky woods.&nbsp; There
rose upon all sides the voice of falling water, not condensed and
formidable as in the gorge of the river, but scattered and
sounding gaily and musically from glen to glen.&nbsp; Here, too,
the spirits of my driver mended, and he began to sing aloud in a
falsetto voice, and with a singular bluntness of musical
perception, never true either to melody or key, but wandering at
will, and yet somehow with an effect that was natural and
pleasing, like that of the of birds.&nbsp; As the dusk increased,
I fell more and more under the spell of this artless warbling,
listening and waiting for some articulate air, and still
disappointed; and when at last I asked him what it was he
sang&mdash;&lsquo;O,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;I am just
singing!&rsquo;&nbsp; Above all, I was taken with a trick he had
of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals; it
was not so monotonous as you would think, or, at least, not
disagreeable; and it seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment
with what is, such as we love to fancy in the attitude of trees,
or the quiescence of a pool.</p>
<p>Night had fallen dark before we came out upon a plateau, and
drew up a little after, before a certain lump of superior
blackness which I could only conjecture to be the
residencia.&nbsp; Here, my guide, getting down from the cart,
hooted and whistled for a long time in vain; until at last an old
peasant man came towards us from somewhere in the surrounding
dark, carrying a candle in his hand.&nbsp; By the light of this I
was able to perceive a great arched doorway of a Moorish
character: it was closed by iron-studded gates, in one of the
leaves of which Felipe opened a wicket.&nbsp; The peasant carried
off the cart to some out-building; but my guide and I passed
through the wicket, which was closed again behind us; and by the
glimmer of the candle, passed through a court, up a stone stair,
along a section of an open gallery, and up more stairs again,
until we came at last to the door of a great and somewhat bare
apartment.&nbsp; This room, which I understood was to be mine,
was pierced by three windows, lined with some lustrous wood
disposed in panels, and carpeted with the skins of many savage
animals.&nbsp; A bright fire burned in the chimney, and shed
abroad a changeful flicker; close up to the blaze there was drawn
a table, laid for supper; and in the far end a bed stood
ready.&nbsp; I was pleased by these preparations, and said so to
Felipe; and he, with the same simplicity of disposition that I
held already remarked in him, warmly re-echoed my praises.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A fine room,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;a very fine
room.&nbsp; And fire, too; fire is good; it melts out the
pleasure in your bones.&nbsp; And the bed,&rsquo; he continued,
carrying over the candle in that direction&mdash;&lsquo;see what
fine sheets&mdash;how soft, how smooth, smooth;&rsquo; and he
passed his hand again and again over their texture, and then laid
down his head and rubbed his cheeks among them with a grossness
of content that somehow offended me.&nbsp; I took the candle from
his hand (for I feared he would set the bed on fire) and walked
back to the supper-table, where, perceiving a measure of wine, I
poured out a cup and called to him to come and drink of it.&nbsp;
He started to his feet at once and ran to me with a strong
expression of hope; but when he saw the wine, he visibly
shuddered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;not that; that is for
you.&nbsp; I hate it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Senor,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;then I will
drink to your good health, and to the prosperity of your house
and family.&nbsp; Speaking of which,&rsquo; I added, after I had
drunk, &lsquo;shall I not have the pleasure of laying my
salutations in person at the feet of the Senora, your
mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But at these words all the childishness passed out of his
face, and was succeeded by a look of indescribable cunning and
secrecy.&nbsp; He backed away from me at the same time, as though
I were an animal about to leap or some dangerous fellow with a
weapon, and when he had got near the door, glowered at me
sullenly with contracted pupils.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said
at last, and the next moment was gone noiselessly out of the
room; and I heard his footing die away downstairs as light as
rainfall, and silence closed over the house.</p>
<p>After I had supped I drew up the table nearer to the bed and
began to prepare for rest; but in the new position of the light,
I was struck by a picture on the wall.&nbsp; It represented a
woman, still young.&nbsp; To judge by her costume and the mellow
unity which reigned over the canvas, she had long been dead; to
judge by the vivacity of the attitude, the eyes and the features,
I might have been beholding in a mirror the image of life.&nbsp;
Her figure was very slim and strong, and of a just proportion;
red tresses lay like a crown over her brow; her eyes, of a very
golden brown, held mine with a look; and her face, which was
perfectly shaped, was yet marred by a cruel, sullen, and sensual
expression.&nbsp; Something in both face and figure, something
exquisitely intangible, like the echo of an echo, suggested the
features and bearing of my guide; and I stood awhile,
unpleasantly attracted and wondering at the oddity of the
resemblance.&nbsp; The common, carnal stock of that race, which
had been originally designed for such high dames as the one now
looking on me from the canvas, had fallen to baser uses, wearing
country clothes, sitting on the shaft and holding the reins of a
mule cart, to bring home a lodger.&nbsp; Perhaps an actual link
subsisted; perhaps some scruple of the delicate flesh that was
once clothed upon with the satin and brocade of the dead lady,
now winced at the rude contact of Felipe&rsquo;s frieze.</p>
<p>The first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait,
and, as I lay awake, my eyes continued to dwell upon it with
growing complacency; its beauty crept about my heart insidiously,
silencing my scruples one after another; and while I knew that to
love such a woman were to sign and seal one&rsquo;s own sentence
of degeneration, I still knew that, if she were alive, I should
love her.&nbsp; Day after day the double knowledge of her
wickedness and of my weakness grew clearer.&nbsp; She came to be
the heroine of many day-dreams, in which her eyes led on to, and
sufficiently rewarded, crimes.&nbsp; She cast a dark shadow on my
fancy; and when I was out in the free air of heaven, taking
vigorous exercise and healthily renewing the current of my blood,
it was often a glad thought to me that my enchantress was safe in
the grave, her wand of beauty broken, her lips closed in silence,
her philtre spilt.&nbsp; And yet I had a half-lingering terror
that she might not be dead after all, but re-arisen in the body
of some descendant.</p>
<p>Felipe served my meals in my own apartment; and his
resemblance to the portrait haunted me.&nbsp; At times it was
not; at times, upon some change of attitude or flash of
expression, it would leap out upon me like a ghost.&nbsp; It was
above all in his ill tempers that the likeness triumphed.&nbsp;
He certainly liked me; he was proud of my notice, which he sought
to engage by many simple and childlike devices; he loved to sit
close before my fire, talking his broken talk or singing his odd,
endless, wordless songs, and sometimes drawing his hand over my
clothes with an affectionate manner of caressing that never
failed to cause in me an embarrassment of which I was
ashamed.&nbsp; But for all that, he was capable of flashes of
causeless anger and fits of sturdy sullenness.&nbsp; At a word of
reproof, I have seen him upset the dish of which I was about to
eat, and this not surreptitiously, but with defiance; and
similarly at a hint of inquisition.&nbsp; I was not unnaturally
curious, being in a strange place and surrounded by staring
people; but at the shadow of a question, he shrank back, lowering
and dangerous.&nbsp; Then it was that, for a fraction of a
second, this rough lad might have been the brother of the lady in
the frame.&nbsp; But these humours were swift to pass; and the
resemblance died along with them.</p>
<p>In these first days I saw nothing of any one but Felipe,
unless the portrait is to be counted; and since the lad was
plainly of weak mind, and had moments of passion, it may be
wondered that I bore his dangerous neighbourhood with
equanimity.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it was for some time
irksome; but it happened before long that I obtained over him so
complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest.</p>
<p>It fell in this way.&nbsp; He was by nature slothful, and much
of a vagabond, and yet he kept by the house, and not only waited
upon my wants, but laboured every day in the garden or small farm
to the south of the residencia.&nbsp; Here he would be joined by
the peasant whom I had seen on the night of my arrival, and who
dwelt at the far end of the enclosure, about half a mile away, in
a rude out-house; but it was plain to me that, of these two, it
was Felipe who did most; and though I would sometimes see him
throw down his spade and go to sleep among the very plants he had
been digging, his constancy and energy were admirable in
themselves, and still more so since I was well assured they were
foreign to his disposition and the fruit of an ungrateful
effort.&nbsp; But while I admired, I wondered what had called
forth in a lad so shuttle-witted this enduring sense of
duty.&nbsp; How was it sustained?&nbsp; I asked myself, and to
what length did it prevail over his instincts?&nbsp; The priest
was possibly his inspirer; but the priest came one day to the
residencia.&nbsp; I saw him both come and go after an interval of
close upon an hour, from a knoll where I was sketching, and all
that time Felipe continued to labour undisturbed in the
garden.</p>
<p>At last, in a very unworthy spirit, I determined to debauch
the lad from his good resolutions, and, way-laying him at the
gate, easily pursuaded him to join me in a ramble.&nbsp; It was a
fine day, and the woods to which I led him were green and
pleasant and sweet-smelling and alive with the hum of
insects.&nbsp; Here he discovered himself in a fresh character,
mounting up to heights of gaiety that abashed me, and displaying
an energy and grace of movement that delighted the eye.&nbsp; He
leaped, he ran round me in mere glee; he would stop, and look and
listen, and seem to drink in the world like a cordial; and then
he would suddenly spring into a tree with one bound, and hang and
gambol there like one at home.&nbsp; Little as he said to me, and
that of not much import, I have rarely enjoyed more stirring
company; the sight of his delight was a continual feast; the
speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart; and
I might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of
these wants, had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my
pleasure.&nbsp; By some swiftness or dexterity the lad captured a
squirrel in a tree top.&nbsp; He was then some way ahead of me,
but I saw him drop to the ground and crouch there, crying aloud
for pleasure like a child.&nbsp; The sound stirred my sympathies,
it was so fresh and innocent; but as I bettered my pace to draw
near, the cry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart.&nbsp; I have
heard and seen much of the cruelty of lads, and above all of
peasants; but what I now beheld struck me into a passion of
anger.&nbsp; I thrust the fellow aside, plucked the poor brute
out of his hands, and with swift mercy killed it.&nbsp; Then I
turned upon the torturer, spoke to him long out of the heat of my
indignation, calling him names at which he seemed to wither; and
at length, pointing toward the residencia, bade him begone and
leave me, for I chose to walk with men, not with vermin.&nbsp; He
fell upon his knees, and, the words coming to him with more
cleanness than usual, poured out a stream of the most touching
supplications, begging me in mercy to forgive him, to forget what
he had done, to look to the future.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, I try so
hard,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, commandante, bear with
Felipe this once; he will never be a brute again!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon, much more affected than I cared to show, I suffered
myself to be persuaded, and at last shook hands with him and made
it up.&nbsp; But the squirrel, by way of penance, I made him
bury; speaking of the poor thing&rsquo;s beauty, telling him what
pains it had suffered, and how base a thing was the abuse of
strength.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, Felipe,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are
strong indeed; but in my hands you are as helpless as that poor
thing of the trees.&nbsp; Give me your hand in mine.&nbsp; You
cannot remove it.&nbsp; Now suppose that I were cruel like you,
and took a pleasure in pain.&nbsp; I only tighten my hold, and
see how you suffer.&rsquo;&nbsp; He screamed aloud, his face
stricken ashy and dotted with needle points of sweat; and when I
set him free, he fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned
over it like a baby.&nbsp; But he took the lesson in good part;
and whether from that, or from what I had said to him, or the
higher notion he now had of my bodily strength, his original
affection was changed into a dog-like, adoring fidelity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I gained rapidly in health.&nbsp; The residencia
stood on the crown of a stony plateau; on every side the
mountains hemmed it about; only from the roof, where was a
bartizan, there might be seen between two peaks, a small segment
of plain, blue with extreme distance.&nbsp; The air in these
altitudes moved freely and largely; great clouds congregated
there, and were broken up by the wind and left in tatters on the
hilltops; a hoarse, and yet faint rumbling of torrents rose from
all round; and one could there study all the ruder and more
ancient characters of nature in something of their pristine
force.&nbsp; I delighted from the first in the vigorous scenery
and changeful weather; nor less in the antique and dilapidated
mansion where I dwelt.&nbsp; This was a large oblong, flanked at
two opposite corners by bastion-like projections, one of which
commanded the door, while both were loopholed for musketry.&nbsp;
The lower storey was, besides, naked of windows, so that the
building, if garrisoned, could not be carried without
artillery.&nbsp; It enclosed an open court planted with
pomegranate trees.&nbsp; From this a broad flight of marble
stairs ascended to an open gallery, running all round and
resting, towards the court, on slender pillars.&nbsp; Thence
again, several enclosed stairs led to the upper storeys of the
house, which were thus broken up into distinct divisions.&nbsp;
The windows, both within and without, were closely shuttered;
some of the stone-work in the upper parts had fallen; the roof,
in one place, had been wrecked in one of the flurries of wind
which were common in these mountains; and the whole house, in the
strong, beating sunlight, and standing out above a grove of
stunted cork-trees, thickly laden and discoloured with dust,
looked like the sleeping palace of the legend.&nbsp; The court,
in particular, seemed the very home of slumber.&nbsp; A hoarse
cooing of doves haunted about the eaves; the winds were excluded,
but when they blew outside, the mountain dust fell here as thick
as rain, and veiled the red bloom of the pomegranates; shuttered
windows and the closed doors of numerous cellars, and the vacant,
arches of the gallery, enclosed it; and all day long the sun made
broken profiles on the four sides, and paraded the shadow of the
pillars on the gallery floor.&nbsp; At the ground level there
was, however, a certain pillared recess, which bore the marks of
human habitation.&nbsp; Though it was open in front upon the
court, it was yet provided with a chimney, where a wood fire
would he always prettily blazing; and the tile floor was littered
with the skins of animals.</p>
<p>It was in this place that I first saw my hostess.&nbsp; She
had drawn one of the skins forward and sat in the sun, leaning
against a pillar.&nbsp; It was her dress that struck me first of
all, for it was rich and brightly coloured, and shone out in that
dusty courtyard with something of the same relief as the flowers
of the pomegranates.&nbsp; At a second look it was her beauty of
person that took hold of me.&nbsp; As she sat back&mdash;watching
me, I thought, though with invisible eyes&mdash;and wearing at
the same time an expression of almost imbecile good-humour and
contentment, she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet
nobility of attitude that were beyond a statue&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
took off my hat to her in passing, and her face puckered with
suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze;
but she paid no heed to my courtesy.&nbsp; I went forth on my
customary walk a trifle daunted, her idol-like impassivity
haunting me; and when I returned, although she was still in much
the same posture, I was half surprised to see that she had moved
as far as the next pillar, following the sunshine.&nbsp; This
time, however, she addressed me with some trivial salutation,
civilly enough conceived, and uttered in the same deep-chested,
and yet indistinct and lisping tones, that had already baffled
the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son.&nbsp; I answered
rather at a venture; for not only did I fail to take her meaning
with precision, but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed
me.&nbsp; They were unusually large, the iris golden like
Felipe&rsquo;s, but the pupil at that moment so distended that
they seemed almost black; and what affected me was not so much
their size as (what was perhaps its consequence) the singular
insignificance of their regard.&nbsp; A look more blankly stupid
I have never met.&nbsp; My eyes dropped before it even as I
spoke, and I went on my way upstairs to my own room, at once
baffled and embarrassed.&nbsp; Yet, when I came there and saw the
face of the portrait, I was again reminded of the miracle of
family descent.&nbsp; My hostess was, indeed, both older and
fuller in person; her eyes were of a different colour; her face,
besides, was not only free from the ill-significance that
offended and attracted me in the painting; it was devoid of
either good or bad&mdash;a moral blank expressing literally
naught.&nbsp; And yet there was a likeness, not so much speaking
as immanent, not so much in any particular feature as upon the
whole.&nbsp; It should seem, I thought, as if when the master set
his signature to that grave canvas, he had not only caught the
image of one smiling and false-eyed woman, but stamped the
essential quality of a race.</p>
<p>From that day forth, whether I came or went, I was sure to
find the Senora seated in the sun against a pillar, or stretched
on a rug before the fire; only at times she would shift her
station to the top round of the stone staircase, where she lay
with the same nonchalance right across my path.&nbsp; In all
these days, I never knew her to display the least spark of energy
beyond what she expended in brushing and re-brushing her copious
copper-coloured hair, or in lisping out, in the rich and broken
hoarseness of her voice, her customary idle salutations to
myself.&nbsp; These, I think, were her two chief pleasures,
beyond that of mere quiescence.&nbsp; She seemed always proud of
her remarks, as though they had been witticisms: and, indeed,
though they were empty enough, like the conversation of many
respectable persons, and turned on a very narrow range of
subjects, they were never meaningless or incoherent; nay, they
had a certain beauty of their own, breathing, as they did, of her
entire contentment.&nbsp; Now she would speak of the warmth, in
which (like her son) she greatly delighted; now of the flowers of
the pomegranate trees, and now of the white doves and long-winged
swallows that fanned the air of the court.&nbsp; The birds
excited her.&nbsp; As they raked the eaves in their swift flight,
or skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind, she would
sometimes stir, and sit a little up, and seem to awaken from her
doze of satisfaction.&nbsp; But for the rest of her days she lay
luxuriously folded on herself and sunk in sloth and
pleasure.&nbsp; Her invincible content at first annoyed me, but I
came gradually to find repose in the spectacle, until at last it
grew to be my habit to sit down beside her four times in the day,
both coming and going, and to talk with her sleepily, I scarce
knew of what.&nbsp; I had come to like her dull, almost animal
neighbourhood; her beauty and her stupidity soothed and amused
me.&nbsp; I began to find a kind of transcendental good sense in
her remarks, and her unfathomable good nature moved me to
admiration and envy.&nbsp; The liking was returned; she enjoyed
my presence half-unconsciously, as a man in deep meditation may
enjoy the babbling of a brook.&nbsp; I can scarce say she
brightened when I came, for satisfaction was written on her face
eternally, as on some foolish statue&rsquo;s; but I was made
conscious of her pleasure by some more intimate communication
than the sight.&nbsp; And one day, as I set within reach of her
on the marble step, she suddenly shot forth one of her hands and
patted mine.&nbsp; The thing was done, and she was back in her
accustomed attitude, before my mind had received intelligence of
the caress; and when I turned to look her in the face I could
perceive no answerable sentiment.&nbsp; It was plain she attached
no moment to the act, and I blamed myself for my own more uneasy
consciousness.</p>
<p>The sight and (if I may so call it) the acquaintance of the
mother confirmed the view I had already taken of the son.&nbsp;
The family blood had been impoverished, perhaps by long
inbreeding, which I knew to be a common error among the proud and
the exclusive.&nbsp; No decline, indeed, was to be traced in the
body, which had been handed down unimpaired in shapeliness and
strength; and the faces of to-day were struck as sharply from the
mint, as the face of two centuries ago that smiled upon me from
the portrait.&nbsp; But the intelligence (that more precious
heirloom) was degenerate; the treasure of ancestral memory ran
low; and it had required the potent, plebeian crossing of a
muleteer or mountain contrabandista to raise, what approached
hebetude in the mother, into the active oddity of the son.&nbsp;
Yet of the two, it was the mother I preferred.&nbsp; Of Felipe,
vengeful and placable, full of starts and shyings, inconstant as
a hare, I could even conceive as a creature possibly
noxious.&nbsp; Of the mother I had no thoughts but those of
kindness.&nbsp; And indeed, as spectators are apt ignorantly to
take sides, I grew something of a partisan in the enmity which I
perceived to smoulder between them.&nbsp; True, it seemed mostly
on the mother&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; She would sometimes draw in her
breath as he came near, and the pupils of her vacant eyes would
contract as if with horror or fear.&nbsp; Her emotions, such as
they were, were much upon the surface and readily shared; and
this latent repulsion occupied my mind, and kept me wondering on
what grounds it rested, and whether the son was certainly in
fault.</p>
<p>I had been about ten days in the residencia, when there sprang
up a high and harsh wind, carrying clouds of dust.&nbsp; It came
out of malarious lowlands, and over several snowy sierras.&nbsp;
The nerves of those on whom it blew were strung and jangled;
their eyes smarted with the dust; their legs ached under the
burthen of their body; and the touch of one hand upon another
grew to be odious.&nbsp; The wind, besides, came down the gullies
of the hills and stormed about the house with a great, hollow
buzzing and whistling that was wearisome to the ear and dismally
depressing to the mind.&nbsp; It did not so much blow in gusts as
with the steady sweep of a waterfall, so that there was no
remission of discomfort while it blew.&nbsp; But higher upon the
mountain, it was probably of a more variable strength, with
accesses of fury; for there came down at times a far-off wailing,
infinitely grievous to hear; and at times, on one of the high
shelves or terraces, there would start up, and then disperse, a
tower of dust, like the smoke of in explosion.</p>
<p>I no sooner awoke in bed than I was conscious of the nervous
tension and depression of the weather, and the effect grew
stronger as the day proceeded.&nbsp; It was in vain that I
resisted; in vain that I set forth upon my customary
morning&rsquo;s walk; the irrational, unchanging fury of the
storm had soon beat down my strength and wrecked my temper; and I
returned to the residencia, glowing with dry heat, and foul and
gritty with dust.&nbsp; The court had a forlorn appearance; now
and then a glimmer of sun fled over it; now and then the wind
swooped down upon the pomegranates, and scattered the blossoms,
and set the window shutters clapping on the wall.&nbsp; In the
recess the Senora was pacing to and fro with a flushed
countenance and bright eyes; I thought, too, she was speaking to
herself, like one in anger.&nbsp; But when I addressed her with
my customary salutation, she only replied by a sharp gesture and
continued her walk.&nbsp; The weather had distempered even this
impassive creature; and as I went on upstairs I was the less
ashamed of my own discomposure.</p>
<p>All day the wind continued; and I sat in my room and made a
feint of reading, or walked up and down, and listened to the riot
overhead.&nbsp; Night fell, and I had not so much as a
candle.&nbsp; I began to long for some society, and stole down to
the court.&nbsp; It was now plunged in the blue of the first
darkness; but the recess was redly lighted by the fire.&nbsp; The
wood had been piled high, and was crowned by a shock of flames,
which the draught of the chimney brandished to and fro.&nbsp; In
this strong and shaken brightness the Senora continued pacing
from wall to wall with disconnected gestures, clasping her hands,
stretching forth her arms, throwing back her head as in appeal to
heaven.&nbsp; In these disordered movements the beauty and grace
of the woman showed more clearly; but there was a light in her
eye that struck on me unpleasantly; and when I had looked on
awhile in silence, and seemingly unobserved, I turned tail as I
had come, and groped my way back again to my own chamber.</p>
<p>By the time Felipe brought my supper and lights, my nerve was
utterly gone; and, had the lad been such as I was used to seeing
him, I should have kept him (even by force had that been
necessary) to take off the edge from my distasteful
solitude.&nbsp; But on Felipe, also, the wind had exercised its
influence.&nbsp; He had been feverish all day; now that the night
had come he was fallen into a low and tremulous humour that
reacted on my own.&nbsp; The sight of his scared face, his starts
and pallors and sudden harkenings, unstrung me; and when he
dropped and broke a dish, I fairly leaped out of my seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think we are all mad to-day,&rsquo; said I, affecting
to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the black wind,&rsquo; he replied
dolefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;You feel as if you must do something, and
you don&rsquo;t know what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I noted the aptness of the description; but, indeed, Felipe
had sometimes a strange felicity in rendering into words the
sensations of the body.&nbsp; &lsquo;And your mother, too,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;she seems to feel this weather much.&nbsp; Do you
not fear she may be unwell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stared at me a little, and then said, &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
almost defiantly; and the next moment, carrying his hand to his
brow, cried out lamentably on the wind and the noise that made
his head go round like a millwheel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who can be
well?&rsquo; he cried; and, indeed, I could only echo his
question, for I was disturbed enough myself.</p>
<p>I went to bed early, wearied with day-long restlessness, but
the poisonous nature of the wind, and its ungodly and
unintermittent uproar, would not suffer me to sleep.&nbsp; I lay
there and tossed, my nerves and senses on the stretch.&nbsp; At
times I would doze, dream horribly, and wake again; and these
snatches of oblivion confused me as to time.&nbsp; But it must
have been late on in the night, when I was suddenly startled by
an outbreak of pitiable and hateful cries.&nbsp; I leaped from my
bed, supposing I had dreamed; but the cries still continued to
fill the house, cries of pain, I thought, but certainly of rage
also, and so savage and discordant that they shocked the
heart.&nbsp; It was no illusion; some living thing, some lunatic
or some wild animal, was being foully tortured.&nbsp; The thought
of Felipe and the squirrel flashed into my mind, and I ran to the
door, but it had been locked from the outside; and I might shake
it as I pleased, I was a fast prisoner.&nbsp; Still the cries
continued.&nbsp; Now they would dwindle down into a moaning that
seemed to be articulate, and at these times I made sure they must
be human; and again they would break forth and fill the house
with ravings worthy of hell.&nbsp; I stood at the door and gave
ear to them, till at, last they died away.&nbsp; Long after that,
I still lingered and still continued to hear them mingle in fancy
with the storming of the wind; and when at last I crept to my
bed, it was with a deadly sickness and a blackness of horror on
my heart.</p>
<p>It was little wonder if I slept no more.&nbsp; Why had I been
locked in?&nbsp; What had passed?&nbsp; Who was the author of
these indescribable and shocking cries?&nbsp; A human
being?&nbsp; It was inconceivable.&nbsp; A beast?&nbsp; The cries
were scarce quite bestial; and what animal, short of a lion or a
tiger, could thus shake the solid walls of the residencia?&nbsp;
And while I was thus turning over the elements of the mystery, it
came into my mind that I had not yet set eyes upon the daughter
of the house.&nbsp; What was more probable than that the daughter
of the Senora, and the sister of Felipe, should be herself
insane?&nbsp; Or, what more likely than that these ignorant and
half-witted people should seek to manage an afflicted kinswoman
by violence?&nbsp; Here was a solution; and yet when I called to
mind the cries (which I never did without a shuddering chill) it
seemed altogether insufficient: not even cruelty could wring such
cries from madness.&nbsp; But of one thing I was sure: I could
not live in a house where such a thing was half conceivable, and
not probe the matter home and, if necessary, interfere.</p>
<p>The next day came, the wind had blown itself out, and there
was nothing to remind me of the business of the night.&nbsp;
Felipe came to my bedside with obvious cheerfulness; as I passed
through the court, the Senora was sunning herself with her
accustomed immobility; and when I issued from the gateway, I
found the whole face of nature austerely smiling, the heavens of
a cold blue, and sown with great cloud islands, and the
mountain-sides mapped forth into provinces of light and
shadow.&nbsp; A short walk restored me to myself, and renewed
within me the resolve to plumb this mystery; and when, from the
vantage of my knoll, I had seen Felipe pass forth to his labours
in the garden, I returned at once to the residencia to put my
design in practice.&nbsp; The Senora appeared plunged in slumber;
I stood awhile and marked her, but she did not stir; even if my
design were indiscreet, I had little to fear from such a
guardian; and turning away, I mounted to the gallery and began my
exploration of the house.</p>
<p>All morning I went from one door to another, and entered
spacious and faded chambers, some rudely shuttered, some
receiving their full charge of daylight, all empty and
unhomely.&nbsp; It was a rich house, on which Time had breathed
his tarnish and dust had scattered disillusion.&nbsp; The spider
swung there; the bloated tarantula scampered on the cornices;
ants had their crowded highways on the floor of halls of
audience; the big and foul fly, that lives on carrion and is
often the messenger of death, had set up his nest in the rotten
woodwork, and buzzed heavily about the rooms.&nbsp; Here and
there a stool or two, a couch, a bed, or a great carved chair
remained behind, like islets on the bare floors, to testify of
man&rsquo;s bygone habitation; and everywhere the walls were set
with the portraits of the dead.&nbsp; I could judge, by these
decaying effigies, in the house of what a great and what a
handsome race I was then wandering.&nbsp; Many of the men wore
orders on their breasts and had the port of noble offices; the
women were all richly attired; the canvases most of them by
famous hands.&nbsp; But it was not so much these evidences of
greatness that took hold upon my mind, even contrasted, as they
were, with the present depopulation and decay of that great
house.&nbsp; It was rather the parable of family life that I read
in this succession of fair faces and shapely bodies.&nbsp; Never
before had I so realised the miracle of the continued race, the
creation and recreation, the weaving and changing and handing
down of fleshly elements.&nbsp; That a child should be born of
its mother, that it should grow and clothe itself (we know not
how) with humanity, and put on inherited looks, and turn its head
with the manner of one ascendant, and offer its hand with the
gesture of another, are wonders dulled for us by
repetition.&nbsp; But in the singular unity of look, in the
common features and common bearing, of all these painted
generations on the walls of the residencia, the miracle started
out and looked me in the face.&nbsp; And an ancient mirror
falling opportunely in my way, I stood and read my own features a
long while, tracing out on either hand the filaments of descent
and the bonds that knit me with my family.</p>
<p>At last, in the course of these investigations, I opened the
door of a chamber that bore the marks of habitation.&nbsp; It was
of large proportions and faced to the north, where the mountains
were most wildly figured.&nbsp; The embers of a fire smouldered
and smoked upon the hearth, to which a chair had been drawn
close.&nbsp; And yet the aspect of the chamber was ascetic to the
degree of sternness; the chair was uncushioned; the floor and
walls were naked; and beyond the books which lay here and there
in some confusion, there was no instrument of either work or
pleasure.&nbsp; The sight of books in the house of such a family
exceedingly amazed me; and I began with a great hurry, and in
momentary fear of interruption, to go from one to another and
hastily inspect their character.&nbsp; They were of all sorts,
devotional, historical, and scientific, but mostly of a great age
and in the Latin tongue.&nbsp; Some I could see to bear the marks
of constant study; others had been torn across and tossed aside
as if in petulance or disapproval.&nbsp; Lastly, as I cruised
about that empty chamber, I espied some papers written upon with
pencil on a table near the window.&nbsp; An unthinking curiosity
led me to take one up.&nbsp; It bore a copy of verses, very
roughly metred in the original Spanish, and which I may render
somewhat thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Pleasure approached with pain and shame,<br />
Grief with a wreath of lilies came.<br />
Pleasure showed the lovely sun;<br />
Jesu dear, how sweet it shone!<br />
Grief with her worn hand pointed on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesu dear, to thee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shame and confusion at once fell on me; and, laying down the
paper, I beat an immediate retreat from the apartment.&nbsp;
Neither Felipe nor his mother could have read the books nor
written these rough but feeling verses.&nbsp; It was plain I had
stumbled with sacrilegious feet into the room of the daughter of
the house.&nbsp; God knows, my own heart most sharply punished me
for my indiscretion.&nbsp; The thought that I had thus secretly
pushed my way into the confidence of a girl so strangely
situated, and the fear that she might somehow come to hear of it,
oppressed me like guilt.&nbsp; I blamed myself besides for my
suspicions of the night before; wondered that I should ever have
attributed those shocking cries to one of whom I now conceived as
of a saint, spectral of mien, wasted with maceration, bound up in
the practices of a mechanical devotion, and dwelling in a great
isolation of soul with her incongruous relatives; and as I leaned
on the balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the bright
close of pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent
woman, who just then stretched herself and delicately licked her
lips as in the very sensuality of sloth, my mind swiftly compared
the scene with the cold chamber looking northward on the
mountains, where the daughter dwelt.</p>
<p>That same afternoon, as I sat upon my knoll, I saw the Padre
enter the gates of the residencia.&nbsp; The revelation of the
daughter&rsquo;s character had struck home to my fancy, and
almost blotted out the horrors of the night before; but at sight
of this worthy man the memory revived.&nbsp; I descended, then,
from the knoll, and making a circuit among the woods, posted
myself by the wayside to await his passage.&nbsp; As soon as he
appeared I stepped forth and introduced myself as the lodger of
the residencia.&nbsp; He had a very strong, honest countenance,
on which it was easy to read the mingled emotions with which he
regarded me, as a foreigner, a heretic, and yet one who had been
wounded for the good cause.&nbsp; Of the family at the residencia
he spoke with reserve, and yet with respect.&nbsp; I mentioned
that I had not yet seen the daughter, whereupon he remarked that
that was as it should be, and looked at me a little
askance.&nbsp; Lastly, I plucked up courage to refer to the cries
that had disturbed me in the night.&nbsp; He heard me out in
silence, and then stopped and partly turned about, as though to
mark beyond doubt that he was dismissing me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you take tobacco powder?&rsquo; said he, offering
his snuff-box; and then, when I had refused, &lsquo;I am an old
man,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and I may be allowed to remind you
that you are a guest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have, then, your authority,&rsquo; I returned, firmly
enough, although I flushed at the implied reproof, &lsquo;to let
things take their course, and not to interfere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and with a somewhat uneasy salute
turned and left me where I was.&nbsp; But he had done two things:
he had set my conscience at rest, and he had awakened my
delicacy.&nbsp; I made a great effort, once more dismissed the
recollections of the night, and fell once more to brooding on my
saintly poetess.&nbsp; At the same time, I could not quite forget
that I had been locked in, and that night when Felipe brought me
my supper I attacked him warily on both points of interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never see your sister,&rsquo; said I casually.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;she is a good, good
girl,&rsquo; and his mind instantly veered to something else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sister is pious, I suppose?&rsquo; I asked in the
next pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he cried, joining his hands with extreme
fervour, &lsquo;a saint; it is she that keeps me up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very fortunate,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for the
most of us, I am afraid, and myself among the number, are better
at going down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Senor,&rsquo; said Felipe earnestly, &lsquo;I would not
say that.&nbsp; You should not tempt your angel.&nbsp; If one
goes down, where is he to stop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Felipe,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I had no guess you
were a preacher, and I may say a good one; but I suppose that is
your sister&rsquo;s doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded at me with round eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;she has
doubtless reproved you for your sin of cruelty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twelve times!&rsquo; he cried; for this was the phrase
by which the odd creature expressed the sense of frequency.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I told her you had done so&mdash;I remembered
that,&rsquo; he added proudly&mdash;&lsquo;and she was
pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Felipe,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what were those
cries that I heard last night? for surely they were cries of some
creature in suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wind,&rsquo; returned Felipe, looking in the
fire.</p>
<p>I took his hand in mine, at which, thinking it to be a caress,
he smiled with a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming
my resolve.&nbsp; But I trod the weakness down.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
wind,&rsquo; I repeated; &lsquo;and yet I think it was this
hand,&rsquo; holding it up, &lsquo;that had first locked me
in.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lad shook visibly, but answered never a
word.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am a stranger
and a guest.&nbsp; It is not my part either to meddle or to judge
in your affairs; in these you shall take your sister&rsquo;s
counsel, which I cannot doubt to be excellent.&nbsp; But in so
far as concerns my own I will be no man&rsquo;s prisoner, and I
demand that key.&rsquo;&nbsp; Half an hour later my door was
suddenly thrown open, and the key tossed ringing on the
floor.</p>
<p>A day or two after I came in from a walk a little before the
point of noon.&nbsp; The Senora was lying lapped in slumber on
the threshold of the recess; the pigeons dozed below the eaves
like snowdrifts; the house was under a deep spell of noontide
quiet; and only a wandering and gentle wind from the mountain
stole round the galleries, rustled among the pomegranates, and
pleasantly stirred the shadows.&nbsp; Something in the stillness
moved me to imitation, and I went very lightly across the court
and up the marble staircase.&nbsp; My foot was on the topmost
round, when a door opened, and I found myself face to face with
Olalla.&nbsp; Surprise transfixed me; her loveliness struck to my
heart; she glowed in the deep shadow of the gallery, a gem of
colour; her eyes took hold upon mine and clung there, and bound
us together like the joining of hands; and the moments we thus
stood face to face, drinking each other in, were sacramental and
the wedding of souls.&nbsp; I know not how long it was before I
awoke out of a deep trance, and, hastily bowing, passed on into
the upper stair.&nbsp; She did not move, but followed me with her
great, thirsting eyes; and as I passed out of sight it seemed to
me as if she paled and faded.</p>
<p>In my own room, I opened the window and looked out, and could
not think what change had come upon that austere field of
mountains that it should thus sing and shine under the lofty
heaven.&nbsp; I had seen her&mdash;Olalla!&nbsp; And the stone
crags answered, Olalla! and the dumb, unfathomable azure
answered, Olalla!&nbsp; The pale saint of my dreams had vanished
for ever; and in her place I beheld this maiden on whom God had
lavished the richest colours and the most exuberant energies of
life, whom he had made active as a deer, slender as a reed, and
in whose great eyes he had lighted the torches of the soul.&nbsp;
The thrill of her young life, strung like a wild animal&rsquo;s,
had entered into me; the force of soul that had looked out from
her eyes and conquered mine, mantled about my heart and sprang to
my lips in singing.&nbsp; She passed through my veins: she was
one with me.</p>
<p>I will not say that this enthusiasm declined; rather my soul
held out in its ecstasy as in a strong castle, and was there
besieged by cold and sorrowful considerations.&nbsp; I could not
doubt but that I loved her at first sight, and already with a
quivering ardour that was strange to my experience.&nbsp; What
then was to follow?&nbsp; She was the child of an afflicted
house, the Senora&rsquo;s daughter, the sister of Felipe; she
bore it even in her beauty.&nbsp; She had the lightness and
swiftness of the one, swift as an arrow, light as dew; like the
other, she shone on the pale background of the world with the
brilliancy of flowers.&nbsp; I could not call by the name of
brother that half-witted lad, nor by the name of mother that
immovable and lovely thing of flesh, whose silly eyes and
perpetual simper now recurred to my mind like something
hateful.&nbsp; And if I could not marry, what then?&nbsp; She was
helplessly unprotected; her eyes, in that single and long glance
which had been all our intercourse, had confessed a weakness
equal to my own; but in my heart I knew her for the student of
the cold northern chamber, and the writer of the sorrowful lines;
and this was a knowledge to disarm a brute.&nbsp; To flee was
more than I could find courage for; but I registered a vow of
unsleeping circumspection.</p>
<p>As I turned from the window, my eyes alighted on the
portrait.&nbsp; It had fallen dead, like a candle after sunrise;
it followed me with eyes of paint.&nbsp; I knew it to be like,
and marvelled at the tenacity of type in that declining race; but
the likeness was swallowed up in difference.&nbsp; I remembered
how it had seemed to me a thing unapproachable in the life, a
creature rather of the painter&rsquo;s craft than of the modesty
of nature, and I marvelled at the thought, and exulted in the
image of Olalla.&nbsp; Beauty I had seen before, and not been
charmed, and I had been often drawn to women, who were not
beautiful except to me; but in Olalla all that I desired and had
not dared to imagine was united.</p>
<p>I did not see her the next day, and my heart ached and my eyes
longed for her, as men long for morning.&nbsp; But the day after,
when I returned, about my usual hour, she was once more on the
gallery, and our looks once more met and embraced.&nbsp; I would
have spoken, I would have drawn near to her; but strongly as she
plucked at my heart, drawing me like a magnet, something yet more
imperious withheld me; and I could only bow and pass by; and she,
leaving my salutation unanswered, only followed me with her noble
eyes.</p>
<p>I had now her image by rote, and as I conned the traits in
memory it seemed as if I read her very heart.&nbsp; She was
dressed with something of her mother&rsquo;s coquetry, and love
of positive colour.&nbsp; Her robe, which I know she must have
made with her own hands, clung about her with a cunning
grace.&nbsp; After the fashion of that country, besides, her
bodice stood open in the middle, in a long slit, and here, in
spite of the poverty of the house, a gold coin, hanging by a
ribbon, lay on her brown bosom.&nbsp; These were proofs, had any
been needed, of her inborn delight in life and her own
loveliness.&nbsp; On the other hand, in her eyes that hung upon
mine, I could read depth beyond depth of passion and sadness,
lights of poetry and hope, blacknesses of despair, and thoughts
that were above the earth.&nbsp; It was a lovely body, but the
inmate, the soul, was more than worthy of that lodging.&nbsp;
Should I leave this incomparable flower to wither unseen on these
rough mountains?&nbsp; Should I despise the great gift offered me
in the eloquent silence of her eyes?&nbsp; Here was a soul
immured; should I not burst its prison?&nbsp; All side
considerations fell off from me; were she the child of Herod I
swore I should make her mine; and that very evening I set myself,
with a mingled sense of treachery and disgrace, to captivate the
brother.&nbsp; Perhaps I read him with more favourable eyes,
perhaps the thought of his sister always summoned up the better
qualities of that imperfect soul; but he had never seemed to me
so amiable, and his very likeness to Olalla, while it annoyed,
yet softened me.</p>
<p>A third day passed in vain&mdash;an empty desert of
hours.&nbsp; I would not lose a chance, and loitered all
afternoon in the court where (to give myself a countenance) I
spoke more than usual with the Senora.&nbsp; God knows it was
with a most tender and sincere interest that I now studied her;
and even as for Felipe, so now for the mother, I was conscious of
a growing warmth of toleration.&nbsp; And yet I wondered.&nbsp;
Even while I spoke with her, she would doze off into a little
sleep, and presently awake again without embarrassment; and this
composure staggered me.&nbsp; And again, as I marked her make
infinitesimal changes in her posture, savouring and lingering on
the bodily pleasure of the movement, I was driven to wonder at
this depth of passive sensuality.&nbsp; She lived in her body;
and her consciousness was all sunk into and disseminated through
her members, where it luxuriously dwelt.&nbsp; Lastly, I could
not grow accustomed to her eyes.&nbsp; Each time she turned on me
these great beautiful and meaningless orbs, wide open to the day,
but closed against human inquiry&mdash;each time I had occasion
to observe the lively changes of her pupils which expanded and
contracted in a breath&mdash;I know not what it was came over me,
I can find no name for the mingled feeling of disappointment,
annoyance, and distaste that jarred along my nerves.&nbsp; I
tried her on a variety of subjects, equally in vain; and at last
led the talk to her daughter.&nbsp; But even there she proved
indifferent; said she was pretty, which (as with children) was
her highest word of commendation, but was plainly incapable of
any higher thought; and when I remarked that Olalla seemed
silent, merely yawned in my face and replied that speech was of
no great use when you had nothing to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;People
speak much, very much,&rsquo; she added, looking at me with
expanded pupils; and then again yawned and again showed me a
mouth that was as dainty as a toy.&nbsp; This time I took the
hint, and, leaving her to her repose, went up into my own chamber
to sit by the open window, looking on the hills and not beholding
them, sunk in lustrous and deep dreams, and hearkening in fancy
to the note of a voice that I had never heard.</p>
<p>I awoke on the fifth morning with a brightness of anticipation
that seemed to challenge fate.&nbsp; I was sure of myself, light
of heart and foot, and resolved to put my love incontinently to
the touch of knowledge.&nbsp; It should lie no longer under the
bonds of silence, a dumb thing, living by the eye only, like the
love of beasts; but should now put on the spirit, and enter upon
the joys of the complete human intimacy.&nbsp; I thought of it
with wild hopes, like a voyager to El Dorado; into that unknown
and lovely country of her soul, I no longer trembled to
adventure.&nbsp; Yet when I did indeed encounter her, the same
force of passion descended on me and at once submerged my mind;
speech seemed to drop away from me like a childish habit; and I
but drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to the margin of
a gulf.&nbsp; She drew back from me a little as I came; but her
eyes did not waver from mine, and these lured me forward.&nbsp;
At last, when I was already within reach of her, I stopped.&nbsp;
Words were denied me; if I advanced I could but clasp her to my
heart in silence; and all that was sane in me, all that was still
unconquered, revolted against the thought of such an
accost.&nbsp; So we stood for a second, all our life in our eyes,
exchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting; and then,
with a great effort of the will, and conscious at the same time
of a sudden bitterness of disappointment, I turned and went away
in the same silence.</p>
<p>What power lay upon me that I could not speak?&nbsp; And she,
why was she also silent?&nbsp; Why did she draw away before me
dumbly, with fascinated eyes?&nbsp; Was this love? or was it a
mere brute attraction, mindless and inevitable, like that of the
magnet for the steel?&nbsp; We had never spoken, we were wholly
strangers: and yet an influence, strong as the grasp of a giant,
swept us silently together.&nbsp; On my side, it filled me with
impatience; and yet I was sure that she was worthy; I had seen
her books, read her verses, and thus, in a sense, divined the
soul of my mistress.&nbsp; But on her side, it struck me almost
cold.&nbsp; Of me, she knew nothing but my bodily favour; she was
drawn to me as stones fall to the earth; the laws that rule the
earth conducted her, unconsenting, to my arms; and I drew back at
the thought of such a bridal, and began to be jealous for
myself.&nbsp; It was not thus that I desired to be loved.&nbsp;
And then I began to fall into a great pity for the girl
herself.&nbsp; I thought how sharp must be her mortification,
that she, the student, the recluse, Felipe&rsquo;s saintly
monitress, should have thus confessed an overweening weakness for
a man with whom she had never exchanged a word.&nbsp; And at the
coming of pity, all other thoughts were swallowed up; and I
longed only to find and console and reassure her; to tell her how
wholly her love was returned on my side, and how her choice, even
if blindly made, was not unworthy.</p>
<p>The next day it was glorious weather; depth upon depth of blue
over-canopied the mountains; the sun shone wide; and the wind in
the trees and the many falling torrents in the mountains filled
the air with delicate and haunting music.&nbsp; Yet I was
prostrated with sadness.&nbsp; My heart wept for the sight of
Olalla, as a child weeps for its mother.&nbsp; I sat down on a
boulder on the verge of the low cliffs that bound the plateau to
the north.&nbsp; Thence I looked down into the wooded valley of a
stream, where no foot came.&nbsp; In the mood I was in, it was
even touching to behold the place untenanted; it lacked Olalla;
and I thought of the delight and glory of a life passed wholly
with her in that strong air, and among these rugged and lovely
surroundings, at first with a whimpering sentiment, and then
again with such a fiery joy that I seemed to grow in strength and
stature, like a Samson.</p>
<p>And then suddenly I was aware of Olalla drawing near.&nbsp;
She appeared out of a grove of cork-trees, and came straight
towards me; and I stood up and waited.&nbsp; She seemed in her
walking a creature of such life and fire and lightness as amazed
me; yet she came quietly and slowly.&nbsp; Her energy was in the
slowness; but for inimitable strength, I felt she would have run,
she would have flown to me.&nbsp; Still, as she approached, she
kept her eyes lowered to the ground; and when she had drawn quite
near, it was without one glance that she addressed me.&nbsp; At
the first note of her voice I started.&nbsp; It was for this I
had been waiting; this was the last test of my love.&nbsp; And
lo, her enunciation was precise and clear, not lisping and
incomplete like that of her family; and the voice, though deeper
than usual with women, was still both youthful and womanly.&nbsp;
She spoke in a rich chord; golden contralto strains mingled with
hoarseness, as the red threads were mingled with the brown among
her tresses.&nbsp; It was not only a voice that spoke to my heart
directly; but it spoke to me of her.&nbsp; And yet her words
immediately plunged me back upon despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will go away,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her example broke the bonds of my speech; I felt as lightened
of a weight, or as if a spell had been dissolved.&nbsp; I know
not in what words I answered; but, standing before her on the
cliffs, I poured out the whole ardour of my love, telling her
that I lived upon the thought of her, slept only to dream of her
loveliness, and would gladly forswear my country, my language,
and my friends, to live for ever by her side.&nbsp; And then,
strongly commanding myself, I changed the note; I reassured, I
comforted her; I told her I had divined in her a pious and heroic
spirit, with which I was worthy to sympathise, and which I longed
to share and lighten.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nature,&rsquo; I told her,
&lsquo;was the voice of God, which men disobey at peril; and if
we were thus humbly drawn together, ay, even as by a miracle of
love, it must imply a divine fitness in our souls; we must be
made,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;made for one another.&nbsp; We
should be mad rebels,&rsquo; I cried out&mdash;&lsquo;mad rebels
against God, not to obey this instinct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will go to-day,&rsquo;
she repeated, and then with a gesture, and in a sudden, sharp
note&mdash;&lsquo;no, not to-day,&rsquo; she cried,
&lsquo;to-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But at this sign of relenting, power came in upon me in a
tide.&nbsp; I stretched out my arms and called upon her name; and
she leaped to me and clung to me.&nbsp; The hills rocked about
us, the earth quailed; a shock as of a blow went through me and
left me blind and dizzy.&nbsp; And the next moment she had thrust
me back, broken rudely from my arms, and fled with the speed of a
deer among the cork-trees.</p>
<p>I stood and shouted to the mountains; I turned and went back
towards the residencia, waltzing upon air.&nbsp; She sent me
away, and yet I had but to call upon her name and she came to
me.&nbsp; These were but the weaknesses of girls, from which even
she, the strangest of her sex, was not exempted.&nbsp; Go?&nbsp;
Not I, Olalla&mdash;O, not I, Olalla, my Olalla!&nbsp; A bird
sang near by; and in that season, birds were rare.&nbsp; It bade
me be of good cheer.&nbsp; And once more the whole countenance of
nature, from the ponderous and stable mountains down to the
lightest leaf and the smallest darting fly in the shadow of the
groves, began to stir before me and to put on the lineaments of
life and wear a face of awful joy.&nbsp; The sunshine struck upon
the hills, strong as a hammer on the anvil, and the hills shook;
the earth, under that vigorous insulation, yielded up heady
scents; the woods smouldered in the blaze.&nbsp; I felt the
thrill of travail and delight run through the earth.&nbsp;
Something elemental, something rude, violent, and savage, in the
love that sang in my heart, was like a key to nature&rsquo;s
secrets; and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared
alive and friendly.&nbsp; Olalla!&nbsp; Her touch had quickened,
and renewed, and strung me up to the old pitch of concert with
the rugged earth, to a swelling of the soul that men learn to
forget in their polite assemblies.&nbsp; Love burned in me like
rage; tenderness waxed fierce; I hated, I adored, I pitied, I
revered her with ecstasy.&nbsp; She seemed the link that bound me
in with dead things on the one hand, and with our pure and
pitying God upon the other: a thing brutal and divine, and akin
at once to the innocence and to the unbridled forces of the
earth.</p>
<p>My head thus reeling, I came into the courtyard of the
residencia, and the sight of the mother struck me like a
revelation.&nbsp; She sat there, all sloth and contentment,
blinking under the strong sunshine, branded with a passive
enjoyment, a creature set quite apart, before whom my ardour fell
away like a thing ashamed.&nbsp; I stopped a moment, and,
commanding such shaken tones as I was able, said a word or
two.&nbsp; She looked at me with her unfathomable kindness; her
voice in reply sounded vaguely out of the realm of peace in which
she slumbered, and there fell on my mind, for the first time, a
sense of respect for one so uniformly innocent and happy, and I
passed on in a kind of wonder at myself, that I should be so much
disquieted.</p>
<p>On my table there lay a piece of the same yellow paper I had
seen in the north room; it was written on with pencil in the same
hand, Olalla&rsquo;s hand, and I picked it up with a sudden
sinking of alarm, and read, &lsquo;If you have any kindness for
Olalla, if you have any chivalry for a creature sorely wrought,
go from here to-day; in pity, in honour, for the sake of Him who
died, I supplicate that you shall go.&rsquo;&nbsp; I looked at
this awhile in mere stupidity, then I began to awaken to a
weariness and horror of life; the sunshine darkened outside on
the bare hills, and I began to shake like a man in terror.&nbsp;
The vacancy thus suddenly opened in my life unmanned me like a
physical void.&nbsp; It was not my heart, it was not my
happiness, it was life itself that was involved.&nbsp; I could
not lose her.&nbsp; I said so, and stood repeating it.&nbsp; And
then, like one in a dream, I moved to the window, put forth my
hand to open the casement, and thrust it through the pane.&nbsp;
The blood spurted from my wrist; and with an instantaneous
quietude and command of myself, I pressed my thumb on the little
leaping fountain, and reflected what to do.&nbsp; In that empty
room there was nothing to my purpose; I felt, besides, that I
required assistance.&nbsp; There shot into my mind a hope that
Olalla herself might be my helper, and I turned and went down
stairs, still keeping my thumb upon the wound.</p>
<p>There was no sign of either Olalla or Felipe, and I addressed
myself to the recess, whither the Senora had now drawn quite back
and sat dozing close before the fire, for no degree of heat
appeared too much for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I disturb you, but
I must apply to you for help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked up sleepily and asked me what it was, and with the
very words I thought she drew in her breath with a widening of
the nostrils and seemed to come suddenly and fully alive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have cut myself,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and rather
badly.&nbsp; See!&rsquo;&nbsp; And I held out my two hands from
which the blood was oozing and dripping.</p>
<p>Her great eyes opened wide, the pupils shrank into points; a
veil seemed to fall from her face, and leave it sharply
expressive and yet inscrutable.&nbsp; And as I still stood,
marvelling a little at her disturbance, she came swiftly up to
me, and stooped and caught me by the hand; and the next moment my
hand was at her mouth, and she had bitten me to the bone.&nbsp;
The pang of the bite, the sudden spurting of blood, and the
monstrous horror of the act, flashed through me all in one, and I
beat her back; and she sprang at me again and again, with bestial
cries, cries that I recognised, such cries as had awakened me on
the night of the high wind.&nbsp; Her strength was like that of
madness; mine was rapidly ebbing with the loss of blood; my mind
besides was whirling with the abhorrent strangeness of the
onslaught, and I was already forced against the wall, when Olalla
ran betwixt us, and Felipe, following at a bound, pinned down his
mother on the floor.</p>
<p>A trance-like weakness fell upon me; I saw, heard, and felt,
but I was incapable of movement.&nbsp; I heard the struggle roll
to and fro upon the floor, the yells of that catamount ringing up
to Heaven as she strove to reach me.&nbsp; I felt Olalla clasp me
in her arms, her hair falling on my face, and, with the strength
of a man, raise and half drag, half carry me upstairs into my own
room, where she cast me down upon the bed.&nbsp; Then I saw her
hasten to the door and lock it, and stand an instant listening to
the savage cries that shook the residencia.&nbsp; And then, swift
and light as a thought, she was again beside me, binding up my
hand, laying it in her bosom, moaning and mourning over it with
dove-like sounds.&nbsp; They were not words that came to her,
they were sounds more beautiful than speech, infinitely touching,
infinitely tender; and yet as I lay there, a thought stung to my
heart, a thought wounded me like a sword, a thought, like a worm
in a flower, profaned the holiness of my love.&nbsp; Yes, they
were beautiful sounds, and they were inspired by human
tenderness; but was their beauty human?</p>
<p>All day I lay there.&nbsp; For a long time the cries of that
nameless female thing, as she struggled with her half-witted
whelp, resounded through the house, and pierced me with
despairing sorrow and disgust.&nbsp; They were the death-cry of
my love; my love was murdered; was not only dead, but an offence
to me; and yet, think as I pleased, feel as I must, it still
swelled within me like a storm of sweetness, and my heart melted
at her looks and touch.&nbsp; This horror that had sprung out,
this doubt upon Olalla, this savage and bestial strain that ran
not only through the whole behaviour of her family, but found a
place in the very foundations and story of our love&mdash;though
it appalled, though it shocked and sickened me, was yet not of
power to break the knot of my infatuation.</p>
<p>When the cries had ceased, there came a scraping at the door,
by which I knew Felipe was without; and Olalla went and spoke to
him&mdash;I know not what.&nbsp; With that exception, she stayed
close beside me, now kneeling by my bed and fervently praying,
now sitting with her eyes upon mine.&nbsp; So then, for these six
hours I drank in her beauty, and silently perused the story in
her face.&nbsp; I saw the golden coin hover on her breaths; I saw
her eyes darken and brighter, and still speak no language but
that of an unfathomable kindness; I saw the faultless face, and,
through the robe, the lines of the faultless body.&nbsp; Night
came at last, and in the growing darkness of the chamber, the
sight of her slowly melted; but even then the touch of her smooth
hand lingered in mine and talked with me.&nbsp; To lie thus in
deadly weakness and drink in the traits of the beloved, is to
reawake to love from whatever shock of disillusion.&nbsp; I
reasoned with myself; and I shut my eyes on horrors, and again I
was very bold to accept the worst.&nbsp; What mattered it, if
that imperious sentiment survived; if her eyes still beckoned and
attached me; if now, even as before, every fibre of my dull body
yearned and turned to her?&nbsp; Late on in the night some
strength revived in me, and I spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Olalla,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;nothing matters; I ask
nothing; I am content; I love you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knelt down awhile and prayed, and I devoutly respected her
devotions.&nbsp; The moon had begun to shine in upon one side of
each of the three windows, and make a misty clearness in the
room, by which I saw her indistinctly.&nbsp; When she rearose she
made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is for me to speak,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and for
you to listen.&nbsp; I know; you can but guess.&nbsp; I prayed,
how I prayed for you to leave this place.&nbsp; I begged it of
you, and I know you would have granted me even this; or if not, O
let me think so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet you have lived in the world,&rsquo; she said;
after a pause, &lsquo;you are a man and wise; and I am but a
child.&nbsp; Forgive me, if I seem to teach, who am as ignorant
as the trees of the mountain; but those who learn much do but
skim the face of knowledge; they seize the laws, they conceive
the dignity of the design&mdash;the horror of the living fact
fades from their memory.&nbsp; It is we who sit at home with evil
who remember, I think, and are warned and pity.&nbsp; Go, rather,
go now, and keep me in mind.&nbsp; So I shall have a life in the
cherished places of your memory: a life as much my own, as that
which I lead in this body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; I said once more; and reaching out
my weak hand, took hers, and carried it to my lips, and kissed
it.&nbsp; Nor did she resist, but winced a little; and I could
see her look upon me with a frown that was not unkindly, only sad
and baffled.&nbsp; And then it seemed she made a call upon her
resolution; plucked my hand towards her, herself at the same time
leaning somewhat forward, and laid it on the beating of her
heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;There,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;you feel the
very footfall of my life.&nbsp; It only moves for you; it is
yours.&nbsp; But is it even mine?&nbsp; It is mine indeed to
offer you, as I might take the coin from my neck, as I might
break a live branch from a tree, and give it you.&nbsp; And yet
not mine!&nbsp; I dwell, or I think I dwell (if I exist at all),
somewhere apart, an impotent prisoner, and carried about and
deafened by a mob that I disown.&nbsp; This capsule, such as
throbs against the sides of animals, knows you at a touch for its
master; ay, it loves you!&nbsp; But my soul, does my soul?&nbsp;
I think not; I know not, fearing to ask.&nbsp; Yet when you spoke
to me your words were of the soul; it is of the soul that you
ask&mdash;it is only from the soul that you would take
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Olalla,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the soul and the body are
one, and mostly so in love.&nbsp; What the body chooses, the soul
loves; where the body clings, the soul cleaves; body for body,
soul to soul, they come together at God&rsquo;s signal; and the
lower part (if we can call aught low) is only the footstool and
foundation of the highest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;seen the portraits in
the house of my fathers?&nbsp; Have you looked at my mother or at
Felipe?&nbsp; Have your eyes never rested on that picture that
hangs by your bed?&nbsp; She who sat for it died ages ago; and
she did evil in her life.&nbsp; But, look-again: there is my hand
to the least line, there are my eyes and my hair.&nbsp; What is
mine, then, and what am I?&nbsp; If not a curve in this poor body
of mine (which you love, and for the sake of which you dotingly
dream that you love me) not a gesture that I can frame, not a
tone of my voice, not any look from my eyes, no, not even now
when I speak to him I love, but has belonged to others?&nbsp;
Others, ages dead, have wooed other men with my eyes; other men
have heard the pleading of the same voice that now sounds in your
ears.&nbsp; The hands of the dead are in my bosom; they move me,
they pluck me, they guide me; I am a puppet at their command; and
I but reinform features and attributes that have long been laid
aside from evil in the quiet of the grave.&nbsp; Is it me you
love, friend? or the race that made me?&nbsp; The girl who does
not know and cannot answer for the least portion of herself? or
the stream of which she is a transitory eddy, the tree of which
she is the passing fruit?&nbsp; The race exists; it is old, it is
ever young, it carries its eternal destiny in its bosom; upon it,
like waves upon the sea, individual succeeds to individual,
mocked with a semblance of self-control, but they are
nothing.&nbsp; We speak of the soul, but the soul is in the
race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You fret against the common law,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You rebel against the voice of God, which he has made so
winning to convince, so imperious to command.&nbsp; Hear it, and
how it speaks between us!&nbsp; Your hand clings to mine, your
heart leaps at my touch, the unknown elements of which we are
compounded awake and run together at a look; the clay of the
earth remembers its independent life and yearns to join us; we
are drawn together as the stars are turned about in space, or as
the tides ebb and flow, by things older and greater than we
ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;what can I say to
you?&nbsp; My fathers, eight hundred years ago, ruled all this
province: they were wise, great, cunning, and cruel; they were a
picked race of the Spanish; their flags led in war; the king
called them his cousin; the people, when the rope was slung for
them or when they returned and found their hovels smoking,
blasphemed their name.&nbsp; Presently a change began.&nbsp; Man
has risen; if he has sprung from the brutes, he can descend again
to the same level.&nbsp; The breath of weariness blew on their
humanity and the cords relaxed; they began to go down; their
minds fell on sleep, their passions awoke in gusts, heady and
senseless like the wind in the gutters of the mountains; beauty
was still handed down, but no longer the guiding wit nor the
human heart; the seed passed on, it was wrapped in flesh, the
flesh covered the bones, but they were the bones and the flesh of
brutes, and their mind was as the mind of flies.&nbsp; I speak to
you as I dare; but you have seen for yourself how the wheel has
gone backward with my doomed race.&nbsp; I stand, as it were,
upon a little rising ground in this desperate descent, and see
both before and behind, both what we have lost and to what we are
condemned to go farther downward.&nbsp; And shall I&mdash;I that
dwell apart in the house of the dead, my body, loathing its
ways&mdash;shall I repeat the spell?&nbsp; Shall I bind another
spirit, reluctant as my own, into this bewitched and
tempest-broken tenement that I now suffer in?&nbsp; Shall I hand
down this cursed vessel of humanity, charge it with fresh life as
with fresh poison, and dash it, like a fire, in the faces of
posterity?&nbsp; But my vow has been given; the race shall cease
from off the earth.&nbsp; At this hour my brother is making
ready; his foot will soon be on the stair; and you will go with
him and pass out of my sight for ever.&nbsp; Think of me
sometimes as one to whom the lesson of life was very harshly
told, but who heard it with courage; as one who loved you indeed,
but who hated herself so deeply that her love was hateful to her;
as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to keep you
for ever; who had no dearer hope than to forget you, and no
greater fear than to be forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had drawn towards the door as she spoke, her rich voice
sounding softer and farther away; and with the last word she was
gone, and I lay alone in the moonlit chamber.&nbsp; What I might
have done had not I lain bound by my extreme weakness, I know
not; but as it was there fell upon me a great and blank
despair.&nbsp; It was not long before there shone in at the door
the ruddy glimmer of a lantern, and Felipe coming, charged me
without a word upon his shoulders, and carried me down to the
great gate, where the cart was waiting.&nbsp; In the moonlight
the hills stood out sharply, as if they were of cardboard; on the
glimmering surface of the plateau, and from among the low trees
which swung together and sparkled in the wind, the great black
cube of the residencia stood out bulkily, its mass only broken by
three dimly lighted windows in the northern front above the
gate.&nbsp; They were Olalla&rsquo;s windows, and as the cart
jolted onwards I kept my eyes fixed upon them till, where the
road dipped into a valley, they were lost to my view
forever.&nbsp; Felipe walked in silence beside the shafts, but
from time to time he would cheek the mule and seem to look back
upon me; and at length drew quite near and laid his hand upon my
head.&nbsp; There was such kindness in the touch, and such a
simplicity, as of the brutes, that tears broke from me like the
bursting of an artery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Felipe,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;take me where they will
ask no questions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said never a word, but he turned his mule about, end for
end, retraced some part of the way we had gone, and, striking
into another path, led me to the mountain village, which was, as
we say in Scotland, the kirkton of that thinly peopled
district.&nbsp; Some broken memories dwell in my mind of the day
breaking over the plain, of the cart stopping, of arms that
helped me down, of a bare room into which I was carried, and of a
swoon that fell upon me like sleep.</p>
<p>The next day and the days following the old priest was often
at my side with his snuff-box and prayer book, and after a while,
when I began to pick up strength, he told me that I was now on a
fair way to recovery, and must as soon as possible hurry my
departure; whereupon, without naming any reason, he took snuff
and looked at me sideways.&nbsp; I did not affect ignorance; I
knew he must have seen Olalla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;you know that I do not ask in wantonness.&nbsp; What of
that family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said they were very unfortunate; that it seemed a declining
race, and that they were very poor and had been much
neglected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she has not,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thanks,
doubtless, to yourself, she is instructed and wise beyond the use
of women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the Senorita is
well-informed.&nbsp; But the family has been
neglected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The mother?&rsquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the mother too,&rsquo; said the Padre, taking
snuff.&nbsp; &lsquo;But Felipe is a well-intentioned
lad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The mother is odd?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very odd,&rsquo; replied the priest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think, sir, we beat about the bush,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must know more of my affairs than you
allow.&nbsp; You must know my curiosity to be justified on many
grounds.&nbsp; Will you not be frank with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;I will be
very frank with you on matters within my competence; on those of
which I know nothing it does not require much discretion to be
silent.&nbsp; I will not fence with you, I take your meaning
perfectly; and what can I say, but that we are all in God&rsquo;s
hands, and that His ways are not as our ways?&nbsp; I have even
advised with my superiors in the church, but they, too, were
dumb.&nbsp; It is a great mystery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she mad?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will answer you according to my belief.&nbsp; She is
not,&rsquo; returned the Padre, &lsquo;or she was not.&nbsp; When
she was young&mdash;God help me, I fear I neglected that wild
lamb&mdash;she was surely sane; and yet, although it did not run
to such heights, the same strain was already notable; it had been
so before her in her father, ay, and before him, and this
inclined me, perhaps, to think too lightly of it.&nbsp; But these
things go on growing, not only in the individual but in the
race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When she was young,&rsquo; I began, and my voice failed
me for a moment, and it was only with a great effort that I was
able to add, &lsquo;was she like Olalla?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now God forbid!&rsquo; exclaimed the Padre.&nbsp;
&lsquo;God forbid that any man should think so slightingly of my
favourite penitent.&nbsp; No, no; the Senorita (but for her
beauty, which I wish most honestly she had less of) has not a
hair&rsquo;s resemblance to what her mother was at the same
age.&nbsp; I could not bear to have you think so; though, Heaven
knows, it were, perhaps, better that you should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this, I raised myself in bed, and opened my heart to the
old man; telling him of our love and of her decision, owning my
own horrors, my own passing fancies, but telling him that these
were at an end; and with something more than a purely formal
submission, appealing to his judgment.</p>
<p>He heard me very patiently and without surprise; and when I
had done, he sat for some time silent.&nbsp; Then he began:
&lsquo;The church,&rsquo; and instantly broke off again to
apologise.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had forgotten, my child, that you were
not a Christian,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And indeed, upon a
point so highly unusual, even the church can scarce be said to
have decided.&nbsp; But would you have my opinion?&nbsp; The
Senorita is, in a matter of this kind, the best judge; I would
accept her judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the back of that he went away, nor was he thenceforward so
assiduous in his visits; indeed, even when I began to get about
again, he plainly feared and deprecated my society, not as in
distaste but much as a man might be disposed to flee from the
riddling sphynx.&nbsp; The villagers, too, avoided me; they were
unwilling to be my guides upon the mountain.&nbsp; I thought they
looked at me askance, and I made sure that the more superstitious
crossed themselves on my approach.&nbsp; At first I set this down
to my heretical opinions; but it began at length to dawn upon me
that if I was thus redoubted it was because I had stayed at the
residencia.&nbsp; All men despise the savage notions of such
peasantry; and yet I was conscious of a chill shadow that seemed
to fall and dwell upon my love.&nbsp; It did not conquer, but I
may not deify that it restrained my ardour.</p>
<p>Some miles westward of the village there was a gap in the
sierra, from which the eye plunged direct upon the residencia;
and thither it became my daily habit to repair.&nbsp; A wood
crowned the summit; and just where the pathway issued from its
fringes, it was overhung by a considerable shelf of rock, and
that, in its turn, was surmounted by a crucifix of the size of
life and more than usually painful in design.&nbsp; This was my
perch; thence, day after day, I looked down upon the plateau, and
the great old house, and could see Felipe, no bigger than a fly,
going to and fro about the garden.&nbsp; Sometimes mists would
draw across the view, and be broken up again by mountain winds;
sometimes the plain slumbered below me in unbroken sunshine; it
would sometimes be all blotted out by rain.&nbsp; This distant
post, these interrupted sights of the place where my life had
been so strangely changed, suited the indecision of my
humour.&nbsp; I passed whole days there, debating with myself the
various elements of our position; now leaning to the suggestions
of love, now giving an ear to prudence, and in the end halting
irresolute between the two.</p>
<p>One day, as I was sitting on my rock, there came by that way a
somewhat gaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle.&nbsp; He was a
stranger, and plainly did not know me even by repute; for,
instead of keeping the other side, he drew near and sat down
beside me, and we had soon fallen in talk.&nbsp; Among other
things he told me he had been a muleteer, and in former years had
much frequented these mountains; later on, he had followed the
army with his mules, had realised a competence, and was now
living retired with his family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know that house?&rsquo; I inquired, at last,
pointing to the residencia, for I readily wearied of any talk
that kept me from the thought of Olalla.</p>
<p>He looked at me darkly and crossed himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it was there that one
of my comrades sold himself to Satan; the Virgin shield us from
temptations!&nbsp; He has paid the price; he is now burning in
the reddest place in Hell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A fear came upon me; I could answer nothing; and presently the
man resumed, as if to himself: &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;O yes, I know it.&nbsp; I have passed its doors.&nbsp;
There was snow upon the pass, the wind was driving it; sure
enough there was death that night upon the mountains, but there
was worse beside the hearth.&nbsp; I took him by the arm, Senor,
and dragged him to the gate; I conjured him, by all he loved and
respected, to go forth with me; I went on my knees before him in
the snow; and I could see he was moved by my entreaty.&nbsp; And
just then she came out on the gallery, and called him by his
name; and he turned, and there was she standing with a lamp in
her hand and smiling on him to come back.&nbsp; I cried out aloud
to God, and threw my arms about him, but he put me by, and left
me alone.&nbsp; He had made his choice; God help us.&nbsp; I
would pray for him, but to what end? there are sins that not even
the Pope can loose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your friend,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;what became of
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, God knows,&rsquo; said the muleteer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If all be true that we hear, his end was like his sin, a
thing to raise the hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that he was killed?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure enough, he was killed,&rsquo; returned the
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how?&nbsp; Ay, how?&nbsp; But these are
things that it is sin to speak of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The people of that house . . . &rsquo; I began.</p>
<p>But he interrupted me with a savage outburst.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
people?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What people?&nbsp; There
are neither men nor women in that house of Satan&rsquo;s!&nbsp;
What? have you lived here so long, and never heard?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And here he put his mouth to my ear and whispered, as if even the
fowls of the mountain might have over-heard and been stricken
with horror.</p>
<p>What he told me was not true, nor was it even original; being,
indeed, but a new edition, vamped up again by village ignorance
and superstition, of stories nearly as ancient as the race of
man.&nbsp; It was rather the application that appalled me.&nbsp;
In the old days, he said, the church would have burned out that
nest of basilisks; but the arm of the church was now shortened;
his friend Miguel had been unpunished by the hands of men, and
left to the more awful judgment of an offended God.&nbsp; This
was wrong; but it should be so no more.&nbsp; The Padre was sunk
in age; he was even bewitched himself; but the eyes of his flock
were now awake to their own danger; and some day&mdash;ay, and
before long&mdash;the smoke of that house should go up to
heaven.</p>
<p>He left me filled with horror and fear.&nbsp; Which way to
turn I knew not; whether first to warn the Padre, or to carry my
ill-news direct to the threatened inhabitants of the
residencia.&nbsp; Fate was to decide for me; for, while I was
still hesitating, I beheld the veiled figure of a woman drawing
near to me up the pathway.&nbsp; No veil could deceive my
penetration; by every line and every movement I recognised
Olalla; and keeping hidden behind a corner of the rock, I
suffered her to gain the summit.&nbsp; Then I came forward.&nbsp;
She knew me and paused, but did not speak; I, too, remained
silent; and we continued for some time to gaze upon each other
with a passionate sadness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you had gone,&rsquo; she said at
length.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is all that you can do for me&mdash;to
go.&nbsp; It is all I ever asked of you.&nbsp; And you still
stay.&nbsp; But do you know, that every day heaps up the peril of
death, not only on your head, but on ours?&nbsp; A report has
gone about the mountain; it is thought you love me, and the
people will not suffer it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I saw she was already informed of her danger, and I rejoiced
at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Olalla,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I am ready to
go this day, this very hour, but not alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray,
and I stood by and looked now at her and now at the object of her
adoration, now at the living figure of the penitent, and now at
the ghastly, daubed countenance, the painted wounds, and the
projected ribs of the image.&nbsp; The silence was only broken by
the wailing of some large birds that circled sidelong, as if in
surprise or alarm, about the summit of the hills.&nbsp; Presently
Olalla rose again, turned towards me, raised her veil, and, still
leaning with one hand on the shaft of the crucifix, looked upon
me with a pale and sorrowful countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have laid my hand upon the cross,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Padre says you are no Christian; but look
up for a moment with my eyes, and behold the face of the Man of
Sorrows.&nbsp; We are all such as He was&mdash;the inheritors of
sin; we must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours;
there is in all of us&mdash;ay, even in me&mdash;a sparkle of the
divine.&nbsp; Like Him, we must endure for a little while, until
morning returns bringing peace.&nbsp; Suffer me to pass on upon
my way alone; it is thus that I shall be least lonely, counting
for my friend Him who is the friend of all the distressed; it is
thus that I shall be the most happy, having taken my farewell of
earthly happiness, and willingly accepted sorrow for my
portion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the face of the crucifix, and, though I was no
friend to images, and despised that imitative and grimacing art
of which it was a rude example, some sense of what the thing
implied was carried home to my intelligence.&nbsp; The face
looked down upon me with a painful and deadly contraction; but
the rays of a glory encircled it, and reminded me that the
sacrifice was voluntary.&nbsp; It stood there, crowning the rock,
as it still stands on so many highway sides, vainly preaching to
passers-by, an emblem of sad and noble truths; that pleasure is
not an end, but an accident; that pain is the choice of the
magnanimous; that it is best to suffer all things and do
well.&nbsp; I turned and went down the mountain in silence; and
when I looked back for the last time before the wood closed about
my path, I saw Olalla still leaning on the crucifix.</p>
<h2>THE TREASURE OF FRANCHARD.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; BY THE DYING MOUNTEBANK.</h3>
<p>They had sent for the doctor from Bourron before six.&nbsp;
About eight some villagers came round for the performance, and
were told how matters stood.&nbsp; It seemed a liberty for a
mountebank to fall ill like real people, and they made off again
in dudgeon.&nbsp; By ten Madame Tentaillon was gravely alarmed,
and had sent down the street for Doctor Desprez.</p>
<p>The Doctor was at work over his manuscripts in one corner of
the little dining-room, and his wife was asleep over the fire in
another, when the messenger arrived.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sapristi!&rsquo; said the Doctor, &lsquo;you should
have sent for me before.&nbsp; It was a case for
hurry.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he followed the messenger as he was, in
his slippers and skull-cap.</p>
<p>The inn was not thirty yards away, but the messenger did not
stop there; he went in at one door and out by another into the
court, and then led the way by a flight of steps beside the
stable, to the loft where the mountebank lay sick.&nbsp; If
Doctor Desprez were to live a thousand years, he would never
forget his arrival in that room; for not only was the scene
picturesque, but the moment made a date in his existence.&nbsp;
We reckon our lives, I hardly know why, from the date of our
first sorry appearance in society, as if from a first
humiliation; for no actor can come upon the stage with a worse
grace.&nbsp; Not to go further back, which would be judged too
curious, there are subsequently many moving and decisive
accidents in the lives of all, which would make as logical a
period as this of birth.&nbsp; And here, for instance, Doctor
Desprez, a man past forty, who had made what is called a failure
in life, and was moreover married, found himself at a new point
of departure when he opened the door of the loft above
Tentaillon&rsquo;s stable.</p>
<p>It was a large place, lighted only by a single candle set upon
the floor.&nbsp; The mountebank lay on his back upon a pallet; a
large man, with a Quixotic nose inflamed with drinking.&nbsp;
Madame Tentaillon stooped over him, applying a hot water and
mustard embrocation to his feet; and on a chair close by sat a
little fellow of eleven or twelve, with his feet dangling.&nbsp;
These three were the only occupants, except the shadows.&nbsp;
But the shadows were a company in themselves; the extent of the
room exaggerated them to a gigantic size, and from the low
position of the candle the light struck upwards and produced
deformed foreshortenings.&nbsp; The mountebank&rsquo;s profile
was enlarged upon the wall in caricature, and it was strange to
see his nose shorten and lengthen as the flame was blown about by
draughts.&nbsp; As for Madame Tentaillon, her shadow was no more
than a gross hump of shoulders, with now and again a hemisphere
of head.&nbsp; The chair legs were spindled out as long as
stilts, and the boy set perched atop of them, like a cloud, in
the corner of the roof.</p>
<p>It was the boy who took the Doctor&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; He had
a great arched skull, the forehead and the hands of a musician,
and a pair of haunting eyes.&nbsp; It was not merely that these
eyes were large, or steady, or the softest ruddy brown.&nbsp;
There was a look in them, besides, which thrilled the Doctor, and
made him half uneasy.&nbsp; He was sure he had seen such a look
before, and yet he could not remember how or where.&nbsp; It was
as if this boy, who was quite a stranger to him, had the eyes of
an old friend or an old enemy.&nbsp; And the boy would give him
no peace; he seemed profoundly indifferent to what was going on,
or rather abstracted from it in a superior contemplation, beating
gently with his feet against the bars of the chair, and holding
his hands folded on his lap.&nbsp; But, for all that, his eyes
kept following the Doctor about the room with a thoughtful fixity
of gaze.&nbsp; Desprez could not tell whether he was fascinating
the boy, or the boy was fascinating him.&nbsp; He busied himself
over the sick man: he put questions, he felt the pulse, he
jested, he grew a little hot and swore: and still, whenever he
looked round, there were the brown eyes waiting for his with the
same inquiring, melancholy gaze.</p>
<p>At last the Doctor hit on the solution at a leap.&nbsp; He
remembered the look now.&nbsp; The little fellow, although he was
as straight as a dart, had the eyes that go usually with a
crooked back; he was not at all deformed, and yet a deformed
person seemed to be looking at you from below his brows.&nbsp;
The Doctor drew a long breath, he was so much relieved to find a
theory (for he loved theories) and to explain away his
interest.</p>
<p>For all that, he despatched the invalid with unusual haste,
and, still kneeling with one knee on the floor, turned a little
round and looked the boy over at his leisure.&nbsp; The boy was
not in the least put out, but looked placidly back at the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this your father?&rsquo; asked Desprez.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; returned the boy; &lsquo;my
master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you fond of him?&rsquo; continued the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>Madame Tentaillon and Desprez exchanged expressive
glances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is bad, my man,&rsquo; resumed the latter, with a
shade of sternness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every one should be fond of the
dying, or conceal their sentiments; and your master here is
dying.&nbsp; If I have watched a bird a little while stealing my
cherries, I have a thought of disappointment when he flies away
over my garden wall, and I see him steer for the forest and
vanish.&nbsp; How much more a creature such as this, so strong,
so astute, so richly endowed with faculties!&nbsp; When I think
that, in a few hours, the speech will be silenced, the breath
extinct, and even the shadow vanished from the wall, I who never
saw him, this lady who knew him only as a guest, are touched with
some affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy was silent for a little, and appeared to be
reflecting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not know him,&rsquo; he replied at last,
&lsquo;he was a bad man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a little pagan,&rsquo; said the landlady.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For that matter, they are all the same, these mountebanks,
tumblers, artists, and what not.&nbsp; They have no
interior.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the Doctor was still scrutinising the little pagan, his
eyebrows knotted and uplifted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie,&rsquo; said the lad.</p>
<p>Desprez leaped upon him with one of his sudden flashes of
excitement, and felt his head all over from an ethnological point
of view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Celtic, Celtic!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Celtic!&rsquo; cried Madame Tentaillon, who had perhaps
confounded the word with hydrocephalous.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor lad!
is it dangerous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends,&rsquo; returned the Doctor grimly.&nbsp;
And then once more addressing the boy: &lsquo;And what do you do
for your living, Jean-Marie?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tumble,&rsquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So!&nbsp; Tumble?&rsquo; repeated Desprez.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Probably healthful.&nbsp; I hazard the guess, Madame
Tentaillon, that tumbling is a healthful way of life.&nbsp; And
have you never done anything else but tumble?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before I learned that, I used to steal,&rsquo; answered
Jean-Marie gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried the doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
are a nice little man for your age.&nbsp; Madame, when my
<i>confr&egrave;re</i> comes from Bourron, you will communicate
my unfavourable opinion.&nbsp; I leave the case in his hands; but
of course, on any alarming symptom, above all if there should be
a sign of rally, do not hesitate to knock me up.&nbsp; I am a
doctor no longer, I thank God; but I have been one.&nbsp; Good
night, madame.&nbsp; Good sleep to you, Jean-Marie.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; MORNING TALK</h3>
<p>Doctor Desprez always rose early.&nbsp; Before the smoke
arose, before the first cart rattled over the bridge to the
day&rsquo;s labour in the fields, he was to be found wandering in
his garden.&nbsp; Now he would pick a bunch of grapes; now he
would eat a big pear under the trellice; now he would draw all
sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane; now he
would go down and watch the river running endlessly past the
timber landing-place at which he moored his boat.&nbsp; There was
no time, he used to say, for making theories like the early
morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;I rise earlier than any one else in the
village,&rsquo; he once boasted.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a fair
consequence that I know more and wish to do less with my
knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises, and loved a good
theatrical effect to usher in the day.&nbsp; He had a theory of
dew, by which he could predict the weather.&nbsp; Indeed, most
things served him to that end: the sound of the bells from all
the neighbouring villages, the smell of the forest, the visits
and the behaviour of both birds and fishes, the look of the
plants in his garden, the disposition of cloud, the colour of the
light, and last, although not least, the arsenal of
meteorological instruments in a louvre-boarded hutch upon the
lawn.&nbsp; Ever since he had settled at Gretz, he had been
growing more and more into the local meteorologist, the unpaid
champion of the local climate.&nbsp; He thought at first there
was no place so healthful in the arrondissement.&nbsp; By the end
of the second year, he protested there was none so wholesome in
the whole department.&nbsp; And for some time before he met
Jean-Marie he had been prepared to challenge all France and the
better part of Europe for a rival to his chosen spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor,&rsquo; he would say&mdash;&lsquo;doctor is a
foul word.&nbsp; It should not be used to ladies.&nbsp; It
implies disease.&nbsp; I remark it, as a flaw in our
civilisation, that we have not the proper horror of
disease.&nbsp; Now I, for my part, have washed my hands of it; I
have renounced my laureation; I am no doctor; I am only a
worshipper of the true goddess Hygieia.&nbsp; Ah, believe me, it
is she who has the cestus!&nbsp; And here, in this exiguous
hamlet, has she placed her shrine: here she dwells and lavishes
her gifts; here I walk with her in the early morning, and she
shows me how strong she has made the peasants, how fruitful she
has made the fields, how the trees grow up tall and comely under
her eyes, and the fishes in the river become clean and agile at
her presence.&mdash;Rheumatism!&rsquo; he would cry, on some
malapert interruption, &lsquo;O, yes, I believe we do have a
little rheumatism.&nbsp; That could hardly be avoided, you know,
on a river.&nbsp; And of course the place stands a little low;
and the meadows are marshy, there&rsquo;s no doubt.&nbsp; But, my
dear sir, look at Bourron!&nbsp; Bourron stands high.&nbsp;
Bourron is close to the forest; plenty of ozone there, you would
say.&nbsp; Well, compared with Gretz, Bourron is a perfect
shambles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The morning after he had been summoned to the dying
mountebank, the Doctor visited the wharf at the tail of his
garden, and had a long look at the running water.&nbsp; This he
called prayer; but whether his adorations were addressed to the
goddess Hygieia or some more orthodox deity, never plainly
appeared.&nbsp; For he had uttered doubtful oracles, sometimes
declaring that a river was the type of bodily health, sometimes
extolling it as the great moral preacher, continually preaching
peace, continuity, and diligence to man&rsquo;s tormented
spirits.&nbsp; After he had watched a mile or so of the clear
water running by before his eyes, seen a fish or two come to the
surface with a gleam of silver, and sufficiently admired the long
shadows of the trees falling half across the river from the
opposite bank, with patches of moving sunlight in between, he
strolled once more up the garden and through his house into the
street, feeling cool and renovated.</p>
<p>The sound of his feet upon the causeway began the business of
the day; for the village was still sound asleep.&nbsp; The church
tower looked very airy in the sunlight; a few birds that turned
about it, seemed to swim in an atmosphere of more than usual
rarity; and the Doctor, walking in long transparent shadows,
filled his lungs amply, and proclaimed himself well contented
with the morning.</p>
<p>On one of the posts before Tentaillon&rsquo;s carriage entry
he espied a little dark figure perched in a meditative attitude,
and immediately recognised Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; he said, stopping before him humorously,
with a hand on either knee.&nbsp; &lsquo;So we rise early in the
morning, do we?&nbsp; It appears to me that we have all the vices
of a philosopher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy got to his feet and made a grave salutation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how is our patient?&rsquo; asked Desprez.</p>
<p>It appeared the patient was about the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why do you rise early in the morning?&rsquo; he
pursued.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie, after a long silence, professed that he hardly
knew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hardly know?&rsquo; repeated Desprez.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We hardly know anything, my man, until we try to
learn.&nbsp; Interrogate your consciousness.&nbsp; Come, push me
this inquiry home.&nbsp; Do you like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the boy slowly; &lsquo;yes, I like
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why do you like it?&rsquo; continued the
Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;(We are now pursuing the Socratic
method.)&nbsp; Why do you like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quiet,&rsquo; answered Jean-Marie; &lsquo;and I
have nothing to do; and then I feel as if I were good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Desprez took a seat on the post at the opposite
side.&nbsp; He was beginning to take an interest in the talk, for
the boy plainly thought before he spoke, and tried to answer
truly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It appears you have a taste for feeling
good,&rsquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, there you puzzle
me extremely; for I thought you said you were a thief; and the
two are incompatible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it very bad to steal?&rsquo; asked Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such is the general opinion, little boy,&rsquo; replied
the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but I mean as I stole,&rsquo; explained the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;For I had no choice.&nbsp; I think it is
surely right to have bread; it must be right to have bread, there
comes so plain a want of it.&nbsp; And then they beat me cruelly
if I returned with nothing,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
not ignorant of right and wrong; for before that I had been well
taught by a priest, who was very kind to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; (The
Doctor made a horrible grimace at the word
&lsquo;priest.&rsquo;)&nbsp; &lsquo;But it seemed to me, when one
had nothing to eat and was beaten, it was a different
affair.&nbsp; I would not have stolen for tartlets, I believe;
but any one would steal for baker&rsquo;s bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so I suppose,&rsquo; said the Doctor, with a rising
sneer, &lsquo;you prayed God to forgive you, and explained the
case to Him at length.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir?&rsquo; asked Jean-Marie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do
not see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your priest would see, however,&rsquo; retorted
Desprez.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would he?&rsquo; asked the boy, troubled for the first
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have thought God would have
known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; snarled the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have thought God would have understood
me,&rsquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do not, I see; but
then it was God that made me think so, was it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little boy, little boy,&rsquo; said Dr. Desprez,
&lsquo;I told you already you had the vices of philosophy; if you
display the virtues also, I must go.&nbsp; I am a student of the
blessed laws of health, an observer of plain and temperate nature
in her common walks; and I cannot preserve my equanimity in
presence of a monster.&nbsp; Do you understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will make my meaning clear to you,&rsquo; replied the
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look there at the sky&mdash;behind the
belfry first, where it is so light, and then up and up, turning
your chin back, right to the top of the dome, where it is already
as blue as at noon.&nbsp; Is not that a beautiful colour?&nbsp;
Does it not please the heart?&nbsp; We have seen it all our
lives, until it has grown in with our familiar thoughts.&nbsp;
Now,&rsquo; changing his tone, &lsquo;suppose that sky to become
suddenly of a live and fiery amber, like the colour of clear
coals, and growing scarlet towards the top&mdash;I do not say it
would be any the less beautiful; but would you like it as
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose not,&rsquo; answered Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither do I like you,&rsquo; returned the Doctor,
roughly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hate all odd people, and you are the most
curious little boy in all the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jean-Marie seemed to ponder for a while, and then he raised
his head again and looked over at the Doctor with an air of
candid inquiry.&nbsp; &lsquo;But are not you a very curious
gentleman?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor threw away his stick, bounded on the boy, clasped
him to his bosom, and kissed him on both cheeks.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Admirable, admirable imp!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a morning, what an hour for a theorist of
forty-two!&nbsp; No,&rsquo; he continued, apostrophising heaven,
&lsquo;I did not know such boys existed; I was ignorant they made
them so; I had doubted of my race; and now!&nbsp; It is
like,&rsquo; he added, picking up his stick, &lsquo;like a
lovers&rsquo; meeting.&nbsp; I have bruised my favourite staff in
that moment of enthusiasm.&nbsp; The injury, however, is not
grave.&rsquo;&nbsp; He caught the boy looking at him in obvious
wonder, embarrassment, and alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;why do you look at me like that?&nbsp; Egad, I believe
the boy despises me.&nbsp; Do you despise me, boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, no,&rsquo; replied Jean-Marie, seriously;
&lsquo;only I do not understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must excuse me, sir,&rsquo; returned the Doctor,
with gravity; &lsquo;I am still so young.&nbsp; O, hang
him!&rsquo; he added to himself.&nbsp; And he took his seat again
and observed the boy sardonically.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has spoiled
the quiet of my morning,&rsquo; thought he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall
be nervous all day, and have a febricule when I digest.&nbsp; Let
me compose myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he dismissed his
pre-occupations by an effort of the will which he had long
practised, and let his soul roam abroad in the contemplation of
the morning.&nbsp; He inhaled the air, tasting it critically as a
connoisseur tastes a vintage, and prolonging the expiration with
hygienic gusto.&nbsp; He counted the little flecks of cloud along
the sky.&nbsp; He followed the movements of the birds round the
church tower&mdash;making long sweeps, hanging poised, or turning
airy somersaults in fancy, and beating the wind with imaginary
pinions.&nbsp; And in this way he regained peace of mind and
animal composure, conscious of his limbs, conscious of the sight
of his eyes, conscious that the air had a cool taste, like a
fruit, at the top of his throat; and at last, in complete
abstraction, he began to sing.&nbsp; The Doctor had but one
air&mdash;, &lsquo;Malbrouck s&rsquo;en va-t-en guerre;&rsquo;
even with that he was on terms of mere politeness; and his
musical exploits were always reserved for moments when he was
alone and entirely happy.</p>
<p>He was recalled to earth rudely by a pained expression on the
boy&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you think of my
singing?&rsquo; he inquired, stopping in the middle of a note;
and then, after he had waited some little while and received no
answer, &lsquo;What do you think of my singing?&rsquo; he
repeated, imperiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not like it,&rsquo; faltered Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, come!&rsquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Possibly you are a performer yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sing better than that,&rsquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>The Doctor eyed him for some seconds in stupefaction.&nbsp; He
was aware that he was angry, and blushed for himself in
consequence, which made him angrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;If this is how
you address your master!&rsquo; he said at last, with a shrug and
a flourish of his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not speak to him at all,&rsquo; returned the
boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not like him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you like me?&rsquo; snapped Doctor Desprez, with
unusual eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; answered Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>The Doctor rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall wish you a good
morning,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are too much for
me.&nbsp; Perhaps you have blood in your veins, perhaps celestial
ichor, or perhaps you circulate nothing more gross than
respirable air; but of one thing I am inexpugnably
assured:&mdash;that you are no human being.&nbsp; No,
boy&rsquo;&mdash;shaking his stick at him&mdash;&lsquo;you are
not a human being.&nbsp; Write, write it in your
memory&mdash;&ldquo;I am not a human being&mdash;I have no
pretension to be a human being&mdash;I am a dive, a dream, an
angel, an acrostic, an illusion&mdash;what you please, but not a
human being.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so accept my humble salutations and
farewell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with that the Doctor made off along the street in some
emotion, and the boy stood, mentally gaping, where he left
him.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; THE ADOPTION.</h3>
<p>Madame Desprez, who answered to the Christian name of
Anastasie, presented an agreeable type of her sex; exceedingly
wholesome to look upon, a stout <i>brune</i>, with cool smooth
cheeks, steady, dark eyes, and hands that neither art nor nature
could improve.&nbsp; She was the sort of person over whom
adversity passes like a summer cloud; she might, in the worst of
conjunctions, knit her brows into one vertical furrow for a
moment, but the next it would be gone.&nbsp; She had much of the
placidity of a contented nun; with little of her piety, however;
for Anastasie was of a very mundane nature, fond of oysters and
old wine, and somewhat bold pleasantries, and devoted to her
husband for her own sake rather than for his.&nbsp; She was
imperturbably good-natured, but had no idea of
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; To live in that pleasant old house, with a
green garden behind and bright flowers about the window, to eat
and drink of the best, to gossip with a neighbour for a quarter
of an hour, never to wear stays or a dress except when she went
to Fontainebleau shopping, to be kept in a continual supply of
racy novels, and to be married to Doctor Desprez and have no
ground of jealousy, filled the cup of her nature to the
brim.&nbsp; Those who had known the Doctor in bachelor days, when
he had aired quite as many theories, but of a different order,
attributed his present philosophy to the study of
Anastasie.&nbsp; It was her brute enjoyment that he rationalised
and perhaps vainly imitated.</p>
<p>Madame Desprez was an artist in the kitchen, and made coffee
to a nicety.&nbsp; She had a knack of tidiness, with which she
had infected the Doctor; everything was in its place; everything
capable of polish shone gloriously; and dust was a thing banished
from her empire.&nbsp; Aline, their single servant, had no other
business in the world but to scour and burnish.&nbsp; So Doctor
Desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf, warmed and
cosseted to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>The midday meal was excellent.&nbsp; There was a ripe melon, a
fish from the river in a memorable Bearnaise sauce, a fat fowl in
a fricassee, and a dish of asparagus, followed by some
fruit.&nbsp; The Doctor drank half a bottle <i>plus</i> one
glass, the wife half a bottle <i>minus</i> the same quantity,
which was a marital privilege, of an excellent
C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie, seven years old.&nbsp; Then the coffee
was brought, and a flask of Chartreuse for madame, for the Doctor
despised and distrusted such decoctions; and then Aline left the
wedded pair to the pleasures of memory and digestion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a very fortunate circumstance, my cherished
one,&rsquo; observed the Doctor&mdash;&lsquo;this coffee is
adorable&mdash;a very fortunate circumstance upon the
whole&mdash;Anastasie, I beseech you, go without that poison for
to-day; only one day, and you will feel the benefit, I pledge my
reputation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this fortunate circumstance, my friend?&rsquo;
inquired Anastasie, not heeding his protest, which was of daily
recurrence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That we have no children, my beautiful,&rsquo; replied
the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think of it more and more as the years
go on, and with more and more gratitude towards the Power that
dispenses such afflictions.&nbsp; Your health, my darling, my
studious quiet, our little kitchen delicacies, how they would all
have suffered, how they would all have been sacrificed!&nbsp; And
for what?&nbsp; Children are the last word of human
imperfection.&nbsp; Health flees before their face.&nbsp; They
cry, my dear; they put vexatious questions; they demand to be
fed, to be washed, to be educated, to have their noses blown; and
then, when the time comes, they break our hearts, as I break this
piece of sugar.&nbsp; A pair of professed egoists, like you and
me, should avoid offspring, like an infidelity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said she; and she laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, that is like you&mdash;to take credit for the thing
you could not help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; returned the Doctor, solemnly,
&lsquo;we might have adopted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; cried madame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never, Doctor,
with my consent.&nbsp; If the child were my own flesh and blood,
I would not say no.&nbsp; But to take another person&rsquo;s
indiscretion on my shoulders, my dear friend, I have too much
sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
both had.&nbsp; And I am all the better pleased with our wisdom,
because&mdash;because&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked at her
sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because what?&rsquo; she asked, with a faint
premonition of danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I have found the right person,&rsquo; said the
Doctor firmly, &lsquo;and shall adopt him this
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anastasie looked at him out of a mist.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
lost your reason,&rsquo; she said; and there was a clang in her
voice that seemed to threaten trouble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, my dear,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;I retain its
complete exercise.&nbsp; To the proof: instead of attempting to
cloak my inconsistency, I have, by way of preparing you, thrown
it into strong relief.&nbsp; You will there, I think, recognise
the philosopher who has the ecstasy to call you wife.&nbsp; The
fact is, I have been reckoning all this while without an
accident.&nbsp; I never thought to find a son of my own.&nbsp;
Now, last night, I found one.&nbsp; Do not unnecessarily alarm
yourself, my dear; he is not a drop of blood to me that I
know.&nbsp; It is his mind, darling, his mind that calls me
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His mind!&rsquo; she repeated with a titter between
scorn and hysterics.&nbsp; &lsquo;His mind, indeed!&nbsp; Henri,
is this an idiotic pleasantry, or are you mad?&nbsp; His
mind!&nbsp; And what of my mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; replied the Doctor with a shrug,
&lsquo;you have your finger on the hitch.&nbsp; He will be
strikingly antipathetic to my ever beautiful Anastasie.&nbsp; She
will never understand him; he will never understand her.&nbsp;
You married the animal side of my nature, dear and it is on the
spiritual side that I find my affinity for Jean-Marie.&nbsp; So
much so, that, to be perfectly frank, I stand in some awe of him
myself.&nbsp; You will easily perceive that I am announcing a
calamity for you.&nbsp; Do not,&rsquo; he broke out in tones of
real solicitude&mdash;&lsquo;do not give way to tears after a
meal, Anastasie.&nbsp; You will certainly give yourself a false
digestion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anastasie controlled herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know how
willing I am to humour you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in all
reasonable matters.&nbsp; But on this point&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear love,&rsquo; interrupted the Doctor, eager to
prevent a refusal, &lsquo;who wished to leave Paris?&nbsp; Who
made me give up cards, and the opera, and the boulevard, and my
social relations, and all that was my life before I knew
you?&nbsp; Have I been faithful?&nbsp; Have I been
obedient?&nbsp; Have I not borne my doom with cheerfulness?&nbsp;
In all honesty, Anastasie, have I not a right to a stipulation on
my side?&nbsp; I have, and you know it.&nbsp; I stipulate my
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anastasie was aware of defeat; she struck her colours
instantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will break my heart,&rsquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will
feel a trifling inconvenience for a month, just as I did when I
was first brought to this vile hamlet; then your admirable sense
and temper will prevail, and I see you already as content as
ever, and making your husband the happiest of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I can refuse you nothing,&rsquo; she said,
with a last flicker of resistance; &lsquo;nothing that will make
you truly happier.&nbsp; But will this?&nbsp; Are you sure, my
husband?&nbsp; Last night, you say, you found him!&nbsp; He may
be the worst of humbugs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But do not suppose me so unwary as to adopt him out of
hand.&nbsp; I am, I flatter myself, a finished man of the world;
I have had all possibilities in view; my plan is contrived to
meet them all.&nbsp; I take the lad as stable boy.&nbsp; If he
pilfer, if he grumble, if he desire to change, I shall see I was
mistaken; I shall recognise him for no son of mine, and send him
tramping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will never do so when the time comes,&rsquo; said
his wife; &lsquo;I know your good heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She reached out her hand to him, with a sigh; the Doctor
smiled as he took it and carried it to his lips; he had gained
his point with greater ease than he had dared to hope; for
perhaps the twentieth time he had proved the efficacy of his
trusty argument, his Excalibur, the hint of a return to
Paris.&nbsp; Six months in the capital, for a man of the
Doctor&rsquo;s antecedents and relations, implied no less a
calamity than total ruin.&nbsp; Anastasie had saved the remainder
of his fortune by keeping him strictly in the country.&nbsp; The
very name of Paris put her in a blue fear; and she would have
allowed her husband to keep a menagerie in the back garden, let
alone adopting a stable-boy, rather than permit the question of
return to be discussed.</p>
<p>About four of the afternoon, the mountebank rendered up his
ghost; he had never been conscious since his seizure.&nbsp;
Doctor Desprez was present at his last passage, and declared the
farce over.&nbsp; Then he took Jean-Marie by the shoulder and led
him out into the inn garden where there was a convenient bench
beside the river.&nbsp; Here he sat him down and made the boy
place himself on his left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie,&rsquo; he said very gravely, &lsquo;this
world is exceedingly vast; and even France, which is only a small
corner of it, is a great place for a little lad like you.&nbsp;
Unfortunately it is full of eager, shouldering people moving on;
and there are very few bakers&rsquo; shops for so many
eaters.&nbsp; Your master is dead; you are not fit to gain a
living by yourself; you do not wish to steal?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
Your situation then is undesirable; it is, for the moment,
critical.&nbsp; On the other hand, you behold in me a man not
old, though elderly, still enjoying the youth of the heart and
the intelligence; a man of instruction; easily situated in this
world&rsquo;s affairs; keeping a good table:&mdash;a man, neither
as friend nor host, to be despised.&nbsp; I offer you your food
and clothes, and to teach you lessons in the evening, which will
be infinitely more to the purpose for a lad of your stamp than
those of all the priests in Europe.&nbsp; I propose no wages, but
if ever you take a thought to leave me, the door shall be open,
and I will give you a hundred francs to start the world
upon.&nbsp; In return, I have an old horse and chaise, which you
would very speedily learn to clean and keep in order.&nbsp; Do
not hurry yourself to answer, and take it or leave it as you
judge aright.&nbsp; Only remember this, that I am no
sentimentalist or charitable person, but a man who lives
rigorously to himself; and that if I make the proposal, it is for
my own ends&mdash;it is because I perceive clearly an advantage
to myself.&nbsp; And now, reflect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be very glad.&nbsp; I do not see what else I
can do.&nbsp; I thank you, sir, most kindly, and I will try to be
useful,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said the Doctor warmly, rising at the
same time and wiping his brow, for he had suffered agonies while
the thing hung in the wind.&nbsp; A refusal, after the scene at
noon, would have placed him in a ridiculous light before
Anastasie.&nbsp; &lsquo;How hot and heavy is the evening, to be
sure!&nbsp; I have always had a fancy to be a fish in summer,
Jean-Marie, here in the Loing beside Gretz.&nbsp; I should lie
under a water-lily and listen to the bells, which must sound most
delicately down below.&nbsp; That would be a life&mdash;do you
not think so too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God you have imagination!&rsquo; cried the
Doctor, embracing the boy with his usual effusive warmth, though
it was a proceeding that seemed to disconcert the sufferer almost
as much as if he had been an English schoolboy of the same
age.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I will take
you to my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Madame Desprez sat in the dining-room in a cool wrapper.&nbsp;
All the blinds were down, and the tile floor had been recently
sprinkled with water; her eyes were half shut, but she affected
to be reading a novel as the they entered.&nbsp; Though she was a
bustling woman, she enjoyed repose between whiles and had a
remarkable appetite for sleep.</p>
<p>The Doctor went through a solemn form of introduction, adding,
for the benefit of both parties, &lsquo;You must try to like each
other for my sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is very pretty,&rsquo; said Anastasie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will you kiss me, my pretty little fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was furious, and dragged her into the
passage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you a fool, Anastasie?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is all this I hear about the tact of
women?&nbsp; Heaven knows, I have not met with it in my
experience.&nbsp; You address my little philosopher as if he were
an infant.&nbsp; He must be spoken to with more respect, I tell
you; he must not be kissed and Georgy-porgy&rsquo;d like an
ordinary child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only did it to please you, I am sure,&rsquo; replied
Anastasie; &lsquo;but I will try to do better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor apologised for his warmth.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I do
wish him,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;to feel at home among
us.&nbsp; And really your conduct was so idiotic, my cherished
one, and so utterly and distantly out of place, that a saint
might have been pardoned a little vehemence in disapproval.&nbsp;
Do, do try&mdash;if it is possible for a woman to understand
young people&mdash;but of course it is not, and I waste my
breath.&nbsp; Hold your tongue as much as possible at least, and
observe my conduct narrowly; it will serve you for a
model.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anastasie did as she was bidden, and considered the
Doctor&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; She observed that he embraced the
boy three times in the course of the evening, and managed
generally to confound and abash the little fellow out of speech
and appetite.&nbsp; But she had the true womanly heroism in
little affairs.&nbsp; Not only did she refrain from the cheap
revenge of exposing the Doctor&rsquo;s errors to himself, but she
did her best to remove their ill-effect on Jean-Marie.&nbsp; When
Desprez went out for his last breath of air before retiring for
the night, she came over to the boy&rsquo;s side and took his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not be surprised nor frightened by my
husband&rsquo;s manners,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is the
kindest of men, but so clever that he is sometimes difficult to
understand.&nbsp; You will soon grow used to him, and then you
will love him, for that nobody can help.&nbsp; As for me, you may
be sure, I shall try to make you happy, and will not bother you
at all.&nbsp; I think we should be excellent friends, you and
I.&nbsp; I am not clever, but I am very good-natured.&nbsp; Will
you give me a kiss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He held up his face, and she took him in her arms and then
began to cry.&nbsp; The woman had spoken in complaisance; but she
had warmed to her own words, and tenderness followed.&nbsp; The
Doctor, entering, found them enlaced: he concluded that his wife
was in fault; and he was just beginning, in an awful voice,
&lsquo;Anastasie&mdash;,&rsquo; when she looked up at him,
smiling, with an upraised finger; and he held his peace,
wondering, while she led the boy to his attic.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE EDUCATION OF A PHILOSOPHER.</h3>
<p>The installation of the adopted stable-boy was thus happily
effected, and the wheels of life continued to run smoothly in the
Doctor&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Jean-Marie did his horse and carriage
duty in the morning; sometimes helped in the housework; sometimes
walked abroad with the Doctor, to drink wisdom from the
fountain-head; and was introduced at night to the sciences and
the dead tongues.&nbsp; He retained his singular placidity of
mind and manner; he was rarely in fault; but he made only a very
partial progress in his studies, and remained much of a stranger
in the family.</p>
<p>The Doctor was a pattern of regularity.&nbsp; All forenoon he
worked on his great book, the &lsquo;Comparative Pharmacopoeia,
or Historical Dictionary of all Medicines,&rsquo; which as yet
consisted principally of slips of paper and pins.&nbsp; When
finished, it was to fill many personable volumes, and to combine
antiquarian interest with professional utility.&nbsp; But the
Doctor was studious of literary graces and the picturesque; an
anecdote, a touch of manners, a moral qualification, or a
sounding epithet was sure to be preferred before a piece of
science; a little more, and he would have written the
&lsquo;Comparative Pharmacopoeia&rsquo; in verse!&nbsp; The
article &lsquo;Mummia,&rsquo; for instance, was already complete,
though the remainder of the work had not progressed beyond the
letter A.&nbsp; It was exceedingly copious and entertaining,
written with quaintness and colour, exact, erudite, a literary
article; but it would hardly have afforded guidance to a
practising physician of to-day.&nbsp; The feminine good sense of
his wife had led her to point this out with uncompromising
sincerity; for the Dictionary was duly read aloud to her, betwixt
sleep and waning, as it proceeded towards an infinitely distant
completion; and the Doctor was a little sore on the subject of
mummies, and sometimes resented an allusion with asperity.</p>
<p>After the midday meal and a proper period of digestion, he
walked, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by Jean-Marie; for
madame would have preferred any hardship rather than walk.</p>
<p>She was, as I have said, a very busy person, continually
occupied about material comforts, and ready to drop asleep over a
novel the instant she was disengaged.&nbsp; This was the less
objectionable, as she never snored or grew distempered in
complexion when she slept.&nbsp; On the contrary, she looked the
very picture of luxurious and appetising ease, and woke without a
start to the perfect possession of her faculties.&nbsp; I am
afraid she was greatly an animal, but she was a very nice animal
to have about.&nbsp; In this way, she had little to do with
Jean-Marie; but the sympathy which had been established between
them on the first night remained unbroken; they held occasional
conversations, mostly on household matters; to the extreme
disappointment of the Doctor, they occasionally sallied off
together to that temple of debasing superstition, the village
church; madame and he, both in their Sunday&rsquo;s best, drove
twice a month to Fontainebleau and returned laden with purchases;
and in short, although the Doctor still continued to regard them
as irreconcilably anti-pathetic, their relation was as intimate,
friendly, and confidential as their natures suffered.</p>
<p>I fear, however, that in her heart of hearts, madame kindly
despised and pitied the boy.&nbsp; She had no admiration for his
class of virtues; she liked a smart, polite, forward, roguish
sort of boy, cap in hand, light of foot, meeting the eye; she
liked volubility, charm, a little vice&mdash;the promise of a
second Doctor Desprez.&nbsp; And it was her indefeasible belief
that Jean-Marie was dull.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor dear boy,&rsquo; she
had said once, &lsquo;how sad it is that he should be so
stupid!&rsquo;&nbsp; She had never repeated that remark, for the
Doctor had raged like a wild bull, denouncing the brutal
bluntness of her mind, bemoaning his own fate to be so unequally
mated with an ass, and, what touched Anastasie more nearly,
menacing the table china by the fury of his gesticulations.&nbsp;
But she adhered silently to her opinion; and when Jean-Marie was
sitting, stolid, blank, but not unhappy, over his unfinished
tasks, she would snatch her opportunity in the Doctor&rsquo;s
absence, go over to him, put her arms about his neck, lay her
cheek to his, and communicate her sympathy with his
distress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not mind,&rsquo; she would say;
&lsquo;I, too, am not at all clever, and I can assure you that it
makes no difference in life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s view was naturally different.&nbsp; That
gentleman never wearied of the sound of his own voice, which was,
to say the truth, agreeable enough to hear.&nbsp; He now had a
listener, who was not so cynically indifferent as Anastasie, and
who sometimes put him on his mettle by the most relevant
objections.&nbsp; Besides, was he not educating the boy?&nbsp;
And education, philosophers are agreed, is the most philosophical
of duties.&nbsp; What can be more heavenly to poor mankind than
to have one&rsquo;s hobby grow into a duty to the State?&nbsp;
Then, indeed, do the ways of life become ways of
pleasantness.&nbsp; Never had the Doctor seen reason to be more
content with his endowments.&nbsp; Philosophy flowed smoothly
from his lips.&nbsp; He was so agile a dialectician that he could
trace his nonsense, when challenged, back to some root in sense,
and prove it to be a sort of flower upon his system.&nbsp; He
slipped out of antinomies like a fish, and left his disciple
marvelling at the rabbi&rsquo;s depth.</p>
<p>Moreover, deep down in his heart the Doctor was disappointed
with the ill-success of his more formal education.&nbsp; A boy,
chosen by so acute an observer for his aptitude, and guided along
the path of learning by so philosophic an instructor, was bound,
by the nature of the universe, to make a more obvious and lasting
advance.&nbsp; Now Jean-Marie was slow in all things,
impenetrable in others; and his power of forgetting was fully on
a level with his power to learn.&nbsp; Therefore the Doctor
cherished his peripatetic lectures, to which the boy attended,
which he generally appeared to enjoy, and by which he often
profited.</p>
<p>Many and many were the talks they had together; and health and
moderation proved the subject of the Doctor&rsquo;s
divagations.&nbsp; To these he lovingly returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I lead you,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;by the green
pastures.&nbsp; My system, my beliefs, my medicines, are resumed
in one phrase&mdash;to avoid excess.&nbsp; Blessed nature,
healthy, temperate nature, abhors and exterminates excess.&nbsp;
Human law, in this matter, imitates at a great distance her
provisions; and we must strive to supplement the efforts of the
law.&nbsp; Yes, boy, we must be a law to ourselves and for
ourselves and for our neighbours&mdash;lex armata&mdash;armed,
emphatic, tyrannous law.&nbsp; If you see a crapulous human ruin
snuffing, dash from him his box!&nbsp; The judge, though in a way
an admission of disease, is less offensive to me than either the
doctor or the priest.&nbsp; Above all the doctor&mdash;the doctor
and the purulent trash and garbage of his pharmacopoeia!&nbsp;
Pure air&mdash;from the neighbourhood of a pinetum for the sake
of the turpentine&mdash;unadulterated wine, and the reflections
of an unsophisticated spirit in the presence of the works of
nature&mdash;these, my boy, are the best medical appliances and
the best religious comforts.&nbsp; Devote yourself to
these.&nbsp; Hark! there are the bells of Bourron (the wind is in
the north, it will be fair).&nbsp; How clear and airy is the
sound!&nbsp; The nerves are harmonised and quieted; the mind
attuned to silence; and observe how easily and regularly beats
the heart!&nbsp; Your unenlightened doctor would see nothing in
these sensations; and yet you yourself perceive they are a part
of health.&mdash;Did you remember your cinchona this
morning?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Cinchona also is a work of nature; it
is, after all, only the bark of a tree which we might gather for
ourselves if we lived in the locality.&mdash;What a world is
this!&nbsp; Though a professed atheist, I delight to bear my
testimony to the world.&nbsp; Look at the gratuitous remedies and
pleasures that surround our path!&nbsp; The river runs by the
garden end, our bath, our fishpond, our natural system of
drainage.&nbsp; There is a well in the court which sends up
sparkling water from the earth&rsquo;s very heart, clean, cool,
and, with a little wine, most wholesome.&nbsp; The district is
notorious for its salubrity; rheumatism is the only prevalent
complaint, and I myself have never had a touch of it.&nbsp; I
tell you&mdash;and my opinion is based upon the coldest, clearest
processes of reason&mdash;if I, if you, desired to leave this
home of pleasures, it would be the duty, it would be the
privilege, of our best friend to prevent us with a pistol
bullet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One beautiful June day they sat upon the hill outside the
village.&nbsp; The river, as blue as heaven, shone here and there
among the foliage.&nbsp; The indefatigable birds turned and
flickered about Gretz church tower.&nbsp; A healthy wind blew
from over the forest, and the sound of innumerable thousands of
tree-tops and innumerable millions on millions of green leaves
was abroad in the air, and filled the ear with something between
whispered speech and singing.&nbsp; It seemed as if every blade
of grass must hide a cigale; and the fields rang merrily with
their music, jingling far and near as with the sleigh-bells of
the fairy queen.&nbsp; From their station on the slope the eye
embraced a large space of poplar&rsquo;d plain upon the one hand,
the waving hill-tops of the forest on the other, and Gretz itself
in the middle, a handful of roofs.&nbsp; Under the bestriding
arch of the blue heavens, the place seemed dwindled to a
toy.&nbsp; It seemed incredible that people dwelt, and could find
room to turn or air to breathe, in such a corner of the
world.&nbsp; The thought came home to the boy, perhaps for the
first time, and he gave it words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How small it looks!&rsquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; replied the Doctor, &lsquo;small enough
now.&nbsp; Yet it was once a walled city; thriving, full of
furred burgesses and men in armour, humming with
affairs;&mdash;with tall spires, for aught that I know, and
portly towers along the battlements.&nbsp; A thousand chimneys
ceased smoking at the curfew bell.&nbsp; There were gibbets at
the gate as thick as scarecrows.&nbsp; In time of war, the
assault swarmed against it with ladders, the arrows fell like
leaves, the defenders sallied hotly over the drawbridge, each
side uttered its cry as they plied their weapons.&nbsp; Do you
know that the walls extended as far as the Commanderie?&nbsp;
Tradition so reports.&nbsp; Alas, what a long way off is all this
confusion&mdash;nothing left of it but my quiet words spoken in
your ear&mdash;and the town itself shrunk to the hamlet
underneath us!&nbsp; By-and-by came the English wars&mdash;you
shall hear more of the English, a stupid people, who sometimes
blundered into good&mdash;and Gretz was taken, sacked, and
burned.&nbsp; It is the history of many towns; but Gretz never
rose again; it was never rebuilt; its ruins were a quarry to
serve the growth of rivals; and the stones of Gretz are now erect
along the streets of Nemours.&nbsp; It gratifies me that our old
house was the first to rise after the calamity; when the town had
come to an end, it inaugurated the hamlet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, too, am glad of that,&rsquo; said Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It should be the temple of the humbler virtues,&rsquo;
responded the Doctor with a savoury gusto.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps
one of the reasons why I love my little hamlet as I do, is that
we have a similar history, she and I.&nbsp; Have I told you that
I was once rich?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think so,&rsquo; answered Jean-Marie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do not think I should have forgotten.&nbsp; I am sorry
you should have lost your fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry?&rsquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I
find I have scarce begun your education after all.&nbsp; Listen
to me!&nbsp; Would you rather live in the old Gretz or in the
new, free from the alarms of war, with the green country at the
door, without noise, passports, the exactions of the soldiery, or
the jangle of the curfew-bell to send us off to bed by
sundown?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I should prefer the new,&rsquo; replied the
boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; returned the Doctor; &lsquo;so do
I.&nbsp; And, in the same way, I prefer my present moderate
fortune to my former wealth.&nbsp; Golden mediocrity! cried the
adorable ancients; and I subscribe to their enthusiasm.&nbsp;
Have I not good wine, good food, good air, the fields and the
forest for my walk, a house, an admirable wife, a boy whom I
protest I cherish like a son?&nbsp; Now, if I were still rich, I
should indubitably make my residence in Paris&mdash;you know
Paris&mdash;Paris and Paradise are not convertible terms.&nbsp;
This pleasant noise of the wind streaming among leaves changed
into the grinding Babel of the street, the stupid glare of
plaster substituted for this quiet pattern of greens and greys,
the nerves shattered, the digestion falsified&mdash;picture the
fall!&nbsp; Already you perceive the consequences; the mind is
stimulated, the heart steps to a different measure, and the man
is himself no longer.&nbsp; I have passionately studied
myself&mdash;the true business of philosophy.&nbsp; I know my
character as the musician knows the ventages of his flute.&nbsp;
Should I return to Paris, I should ruin myself gambling; nay, I
go further&mdash;I should break the heart of my Anastasie with
infidelities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Jean-Marie.&nbsp; That a place should so
transform the most excellent of men transcended his belief.&nbsp;
Paris, he protested, was even an agreeable place of
residence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor when I lived in that city did I feel
much difference,&rsquo; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you not
steal when you were there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the boy could never be brought to see that he had done
anything wrong when he stole.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, did the Doctor
think he had; but that gentleman was never very scrupulous when
in want of a retort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he concluded, &lsquo;do you begin to
understand?&nbsp; My only friends were those who ruined me.&nbsp;
Gretz has been my academy, my sanatorium, my heaven of innocent
pleasures.&nbsp; If millions are offered me, I wave them back:
<i>Retro</i>, <i>Sathanas</i>!&mdash;Evil one, begone!&nbsp; Fix
your mind on my example; despise riches, avoid the debasing
influence of cities.&nbsp; Hygiene&mdash;hygiene and mediocrity
of fortune&mdash;these be your watchwords during life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s system of hygiene strikingly coincided with
his tastes; and his picture of the perfect life was a faithful
description of the one he was leading at the time.&nbsp; But it
is easy to convince a boy, whom you supply with all the facts for
the discussion.&nbsp; And besides, there was one thing admirable
in the philosophy, and that was the enthusiasm of the
philosopher.&nbsp; There was never any one more vigorously
determined to be pleased; and if he was not a great logician, and
so had no right to convince the intellect, he was certainly
something of a poet, and had a fascination to seduce the
heart.&nbsp; What he could not achieve in his customary humour of
a radiant admiration of himself and his circumstances, he
sometimes effected in his fits of gloom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boy,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;avoid me to-day.&nbsp;
If I were superstitious, I should even beg for an interest in
your prayers.&nbsp; I am in the black fit; the evil spirit of
King Saul, the hag of the merchant Abudah, the personal devil of
the medi&aelig;val monk, is with me&mdash;is in me,&rsquo;
tapping on his breast.&nbsp; &lsquo;The vices of my nature are
now uppermost; innocent pleasures woo me in vain; I long for
Paris, for my wallowing in the mire.&nbsp; See,&rsquo; he would
continue, producing a handful of silver, &lsquo;I denude myself,
I am not to be trusted with the price of a fare.&nbsp; Take it,
keep it for me, squander it on deleterious candy, throw it in the
deepest of the river&mdash;I will homologate your action.&nbsp;
Save me from that part of myself which I disown.&nbsp; If you see
me falter, do not hesitate; if necessary, wreck the train!&nbsp;
I speak, of course, by a parable.&nbsp; Any extremity were better
than for me to reach Paris alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless the Doctor enjoyed these little scenes, as a
variation in his part; they represented the Byronic element in
the somewhat artificial poetry of his existence; but to the boy,
though he was dimly aware of their theatricality, they
represented more.&nbsp; The Doctor made perhaps too little, the
boy possibly too much, of the reality and gravity of these
temptations.</p>
<p>One day a great light shone for Jean-Marie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Could
not riches be used well?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In theory, yes,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it is found in experience that no one does so.&nbsp;
All the world imagine they will be exceptional when they grow
wealthy; but possession is debasing, new desires spring up; and
the silly taste for ostentation eats out the heart of
pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you might be better if you had less,&rsquo; said
the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied the Doctor; but his voice
quavered as he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; demanded pitiless innocence.</p>
<p>Doctor Desprez saw all the colours of the rainbow in a moment;
the stable universe appeared to be about capsizing with
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said he&mdash;affecting
deliberation after an obvious pause&mdash;&lsquo;because I have
formed my life for my present income.&nbsp; It is not good for
men of my years to be violently dissevered from their
habits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was a sharp brush.&nbsp; The Doctor breathed hard, and
fell into taciturnity for the afternoon.&nbsp; As for the boy, he
was delighted with the resolution of his doubts; even wondered
that he had not foreseen the obvious and conclusive answer.&nbsp;
His faith in the Doctor was a stout piece of goods.&nbsp; Desprez
was inclined to be a sheet in the wind&rsquo;s eye after dinner,
especially after Rhone wine, his favourite weakness.&nbsp; He
would then remark on the warmth of his feeling for Anastasie, and
with inflamed cheeks and a loose, flustered smile, debate upon
all sorts of topics, and be feebly and indiscreetly witty.&nbsp;
But the adopted stable-boy would not permit himself to entertain
a doubt that savoured of ingratitude.&nbsp; It is quite true that
a man may be a second father to you, and yet take too much to
drink; but the best natures are ever slow to accept such
truths.</p>
<p>The Doctor thoroughly possessed his heart, but perhaps he
exaggerated his influence over his mind.&nbsp; Certainly
Jean-Marie adopted some of his master&rsquo;s opinions, but I
have yet to learn that he ever surrendered one of his own.&nbsp;
Convictions existed in him by divine right; they were virgin,
unwrought, the brute metal of decision.&nbsp; He could add others
indeed, but he could not put away; neither did he care if they
were perfectly agreed among themselves; and his spiritual
pleasures had nothing to do with turning them over or justifying
them in words.&nbsp; Words were with him a mere accomplishment,
like dancing.&nbsp; When he was by himself, his pleasures were
almost vegetable.&nbsp; He would slip into the woods towards
Acheres, and sit in the mouth of a cave among grey birches.&nbsp;
His soul stared straight out of his eyes; he did not move or
think; sunlight, thin shadows moving in the wind, the edge of
firs against the sky, occupied and bound his faculties.&nbsp; He
was pure unity, a spirit wholly abstracted.&nbsp; A single mood
filled him, to which all the objects of sense contributed, as the
colours of the spectrum merge and disappear in white light.</p>
<p>So while the Doctor made himself drunk with words, the adopted
stable-boy bemused himself with silence.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; TREASURE TROVE.</h3>
<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s carriage was a two-wheeled gig with a hood;
a kind of vehicle in much favour among country doctors.&nbsp; On
how many roads has one not seen it, a great way off between the
poplars!&mdash;in how many village streets, tied to a
gate-post!&nbsp; This sort of chariot is
affected&mdash;particularly at the trot&mdash;by a kind of
pitching movement to and fro across the axle, which well entitles
it to the style of a Noddy.&nbsp; The hood describes a
considerable arc against the landscape, with a solemnly absurd
effect on the contemplative pedestrian.&nbsp; To ride in such a
carriage cannot be numbered among the things that appertain to
glory; but I have no doubt it may be useful in liver
complaint.&nbsp; Thence, perhaps, its wide popularity among
physicians.</p>
<p>One morning early, Jean-Marie led forth the Doctor&rsquo;s
noddy, opened the gate, and mounted to the driving-seat.&nbsp;
The Doctor followed, arrayed from top to toe in spotless linen,
armed with an immense flesh-coloured umbrella, and girt with a
botanical case on a baldric; and the equipage drove off smartly
in a breeze of its own provocation.&nbsp; They were bound for
Franchard, to collect plants, with an eye to the
&lsquo;Comparative Pharmacopoeia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little rattling on the open roads, and they came to the
borders of the forest and struck into an unfrequented track; the
noddy yawed softly over the sand, with an accompaniment of
snapping twigs.&nbsp; There was a great, green, softly murmuring
cloud of congregated foliage overhead.&nbsp; In the arcades of
the forest the air retained the freshness of the night.&nbsp; The
athletic bearing of the trees, each carrying its leafy mountain,
pleased the mind like so many statues; and the lines of the trunk
led the eye admiringly upward to where the extreme leaves
sparkled in a patch of azure.&nbsp; Squirrels leaped in mid
air.&nbsp; It was a proper spot for a devotee of the goddess
Hygieia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been to Franchard, Jean-Marie?&rsquo; inquired
the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fancy not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is ruin in a gorge,&rsquo; continued Desprez,
adopting his expository voice; &lsquo;the ruin of a hermitage and
chapel.&nbsp; History tells us much of Franchard; how the recluse
was often slain by robbers; how he lived on a most insufficient
diet; how he was expected to pass his days in prayer.&nbsp; A
letter is preserved, addressed to one of these solitaries by the
superior of his order, full of admirable hygienic advice; bidding
him go from his book to praying, and so back again, for
variety&rsquo;s sake, and when he was weary of both to stroll
about his garden and observe the honey bees.&nbsp; It is to this
day my own system.&nbsp; You must often have remarked me leaving
the &ldquo;Pharmacopoeia&rdquo;&mdash;often even in the middle of
a phrase&mdash;to come forth into the sun and air.&nbsp; I admire
the writer of that letter from my heart; he was a man of thought
on the most important subjects.&nbsp; But, indeed, had I lived in
the Middle Ages (I am heartily glad that I did not) I should have
been an eremite myself&mdash;if I had not been a professed
buffoon, that is.&nbsp; These were the only philosophical lives
yet open: laughter or prayer; sneers, we might say, and
tears.&nbsp; Until the sun of the Positive arose, the wise man
had to make his choice between these two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been a buffoon, of course,&rsquo; observed
Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot imagine you to have excelled in your
profession,&rsquo; said the Doctor, admiring the boy&rsquo;s
gravity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you ever laugh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I laugh
often.&nbsp; I am very fond of jokes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Singular being!&rsquo; said Desprez.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I
divagate (I perceive in a thousand ways that I grow old).&nbsp;
Franchard was at length destroyed in the English wars, the same
that levelled Gretz.&nbsp; But&mdash;here is the point&mdash;the
hermits (for there were already more than one) had foreseen the
danger and carefully concealed the sacrificial vessels.&nbsp;
These vessels were of monstrous value, Jean-Marie&mdash;monstrous
value&mdash;priceless, we may say; exquisitely worked, of
exquisite material.&nbsp; And now, mark me, they have never been
found.&nbsp; In the reign of Louis Quatorze some fellows were
digging hard by the ruins.&nbsp; Suddenly&mdash;tock!&mdash;the
spade hit upon an obstacle.&nbsp; Imagine the men fooling one to
another; imagine how their hearts bounded, how their colour came
and went.&nbsp; It was a coffer, and in Franchard the place of
buried treasure!&nbsp; They tore it open like famished
beasts.&nbsp; Alas! it was not the treasure; only some priestly
robes, which, at the touch of the eating air, fell upon
themselves and instantly wasted into dust.&nbsp; The perspiration
of these good fellows turned cold upon them, Jean-Marie.&nbsp; I
will pledge my reputation, if there was anything like a cutting
wind, one or other had a pneumonia for his trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to have seen them turning into
dust,&rsquo; said Jean-Marie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Otherwise, I should
not have cared so greatly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no imagination,&rsquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Picture to yourself the scene.&nbsp; Dwell on the
idea&mdash;a great treasure lying in the earth for centuries: the
material for a giddy, copious, opulent existence not employed;
dresses and exquisite pictures unseen; the swiftest galloping
horses not stirring a hoof, arrested by a spell; women with the
beautiful faculty of smiles, not smiling; cards, dice, opera
singing, orchestras, castles, beautiful parks and gardens, big
ships with a tower of sailcloth, all lying unborn in a
coffin&mdash;and the stupid trees growing overhead in the
sunlight, year after year.&nbsp; The thought drives one
frantic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only money,&rsquo; replied Jean-Marie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It would do harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, come!&rsquo; cried Desprez, &lsquo;that is
philosophy; it is all very fine, but not to the point just
now.&nbsp; And besides, it is not &ldquo;only money,&rdquo; as
you call it; there are works of art in the question; the vessels
were carved.&nbsp; You speak like a child.&nbsp; You weary me
exceedingly, quoting my words out of all logical connection, like
a parroquet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And at any rate, we have nothing to do with it,&rsquo;
returned the boy submissively.</p>
<p>They struck the Route Ronde at that moment; and the sudden
change to the rattling causeway combined, with the Doctor&rsquo;s
irritation, to keep him silent.&nbsp; The noddy jigged along; the
trees went by, looking on silently, as if they had something on
their minds.&nbsp; The Quadrilateral was passed; then came
Franchard.&nbsp; They put up the horse at the little solitary
inn, and went forth strolling.&nbsp; The gorge was dyed deeply
with heather; the rocks and birches standing luminous in the
sun.&nbsp; A great humming of bees about the flowers disposed
Jean-Marie to sleep, and he sat down against a clump of heather,
while the Doctor went briskly to and fro, with quick turns,
culling his simples.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s head had fallen a little forward, his eyes
were closed, his fingers had fallen lax about his knees, when a
sudden cry called him to his feet.&nbsp; It was a strange sound,
thin and brief; it fell dead, and silence returned as though it
had never been interrupted.&nbsp; He had not recognised the
Doctor&rsquo;s voice; but, as there was no one else in all the
valley, it was plainly the Doctor who had given utterance to the
sound.&nbsp; He looked right and left, and there was Desprez,
standing in a niche between two boulders, and looking round on
his adopted son with a countenance as white as paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A viper!&rsquo; cried Jean-Marie, running towards
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;A viper!&nbsp; You are bitten!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor came down heavily out of the cleft, and, advanced
in silence to meet the boy, whom he took roughly by the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found it,&rsquo; he said, with a gasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A plant?&rsquo; asked Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>Desprez had a fit of unnatural gaiety, which the rocks took up
and mimicked.&nbsp; &lsquo;A plant!&rsquo; he repeated
scornfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;a plant.&nbsp; And
here,&rsquo; he added suddenly, showing his right hand, which he
had hitherto concealed behind his back&mdash;&lsquo;here is one
of the bulbs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jean-Marie saw a dirty platter, coated with earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a
plate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a coach and horses,&rsquo; cried the
Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Boy,&rsquo; he continued, growing warmer,
&lsquo;I plucked away a great pad of moss from between these
boulders, and disclosed a crevice; and when I looked in, what do
you suppose I saw?&nbsp; I saw a house in Paris with a court and
garden, I saw my wife shining with diamonds, I saw myself a
deputy, I saw you&mdash;well, I&mdash;I saw your future,&rsquo;
he concluded, rather feebly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have just discovered
America,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what is it?&rsquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Treasure of Franchard,&rsquo; cried the Doctor;
and, throwing his brown straw hat upon the ground, he whooped
like an Indian and sprang upon Jean-Marie, whom he suffocated
with embraces and bedewed with tears.&nbsp; Then he flung himself
down among the heather and once more laughed until the valley
rang.</p>
<p>But the boy had now an interest of his own, a boy&rsquo;s
interest.&nbsp; No sooner was he released from the Doctor&rsquo;s
accolade than he ran to the boulders, sprang into the niche, and,
thrusting his hand into the crevice, drew forth one after
another, encrusted with the earth of ages, the flagons,
candlesticks, and patens of the hermitage of Franchard.&nbsp; A
casket came last, tightly shut and very heavy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O what fun!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>But when he looked back at the Doctor, who had followed close
behind and was silently observing, the words died from his
lips.&nbsp; Desprez was once more the colour of ashes; his lip
worked and trembled; a sort of bestial greed possessed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is childish,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We lose
precious time.&nbsp; Back to the inn, harness the trap, and bring
it to yon bank.&nbsp; Run for your life, and remember&mdash;not
one whisper.&nbsp; I stay here to watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jean-Marie did as he was bid, though not without
surprise.&nbsp; The noddy was brought round to the spot
indicated; and the two gradually transported the treasure from
its place of concealment to the boot below the driving
seat.&nbsp; Once it was all stored the Doctor recovered his
gaiety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I pay my grateful duties to the genius of this
dell,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, for a live coal, a heifer,
and a jar of country wine!&nbsp; I am in the vein for sacrifice,
for a superb libation.&nbsp; Well, and why not?&nbsp; We are at
Franchard.&nbsp; English pale ale is to be had&mdash;not
classical, indeed, but excellent.&nbsp; Boy, we shall drink
ale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I thought it was so unwholesome,&rsquo; said
Jean-Marie, &lsquo;and very dear besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fiddle-de-dee!&rsquo; exclaimed the Doctor gaily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To the inn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he stepped into the noddy, tossing his head, with an
elastic, youthful air.&nbsp; The horse was turned, and in a few
seconds they drew up beside the palings of the inn garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Desprez&mdash;&lsquo;here, near the
table, so that we may keep an eye upon things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They tied the horse, and entered the garden, the Doctor
singing, now in fantastic high notes, now producing deep
reverberations from his chest.&nbsp; He took a seat, rapped
loudly on the table, assailed the waiter with witticisms; and
when the bottle of Bass was at length produced, far more charged
with gas than the most delirious champagne, he filled out a long
glassful of froth and pushed it over to Jean-Marie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Drink,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;drink deep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather not,&rsquo; faltered the boy, true to
his training.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; thundered Desprez.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid of it,&rsquo; said Jean-Marie: &lsquo;my
stomach&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take it or leave it,&rsquo; interrupted Desprez
fiercely; &lsquo;but understand it once for all&mdash;there is
nothing so contemptible as a precisian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was a new lesson!&nbsp; The boy sat bemused, looking at
the glass but not tasting it, while the Doctor emptied and
refilled his own, at first with clouded brow, but gradually
yielding to the sun, the heady, prickling beverage, and his own
predisposition to be happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once in a way,&rsquo; he said at last, by way of a
concession to the boy&rsquo;s more rigorous attitude, &lsquo;once
in a way, and at so critical a moment, this ale is a nectar for
the gods.&nbsp; The habit, indeed, is debasing; wine, the juice
of the grape, is the true drink of the Frenchman, as I have often
had occasion to point out; and I do not know that I can blame you
for refusing this outlandish stimulant.&nbsp; You can have some
wine and cakes.&nbsp; Is the bottle empty?&nbsp; Well, we will
not be proud; we will have pity on your glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The beer being done, the Doctor chafed bitterly while
Jean-Marie finished his cakes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I burn to be
gone,&rsquo; he said, looking at his watch.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
God, how slow you eat!&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet to eat slowly was his
own particular prescription, the main secret of longevity!</p>
<p>His martyrdom, however, reached an end at last; the pair
resumed their places in the buggy, and Desprez, leaning
luxuriously back, announced his intention of proceeding to
Fontainebleau.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Fontainebleau?&rsquo; repeated Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My words are always measured,&rsquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;On!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was driven through the glades of paradise; the air,
the light, the shining leaves, the very movements of the vehicle,
seemed to fall in tune with his golden meditations; with his head
thrown back, he dreamed a series of sunny visions, ale and
pleasure dancing in his veins.&nbsp; At last he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall telegraph for Casimir,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good Casimir! a fellow of the lower order of intelligence,
Jean-Marie, distinctly not creative, not poetic; and yet he will
repay your study; his fortune is vast, and is entirely due to his
own exertions.&nbsp; He is the very fellow to help us to dispose
of our trinkets, find us a suitable house in Paris, and manage
the details of our installation.&nbsp; Admirable Casimir, one of
my oldest comrades!&nbsp; It was on his advice, I may add, that I
invested my little fortune in Turkish bonds; when we have added
these spoils of the medi&aelig;val church to our stake in the
Mahometan empire, little boy, we shall positively roll among
doubloons, positively roll!&nbsp; Beautiful forest,&rsquo; he
cried, &lsquo;farewell!&nbsp; Though called to other scenes, I
will not forget thee.&nbsp; Thy name is graven in my heart.&nbsp;
Under the influence of prosperity I become dithyrambic,
Jean-Marie.&nbsp; Such is the impulse of the natural soul; such
was the constitution of prim&aelig;val man.&nbsp; And
I&mdash;well, I will not refuse the credit&mdash;I have preserved
my youth like a virginity; another, who should have led the same
snoozing, countryfied existence for these years, another had
become rusted, become stereotype; but I, I praise my happy
constitution, retain the spring unbroken.&nbsp; Fresh opulence
and a new sphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only
more mature by knowledge.&nbsp; For this prospective change,
Jean-Marie&mdash;it may probably have shocked you.&nbsp; Tell me
now, did it not strike you as an inconsistency?&nbsp;
Confess&mdash;it is useless to dissemble&mdash;it pained
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; returned the Doctor, with sublime
fatuity, &lsquo;I read your thoughts!&nbsp; Nor am I
surprised&mdash;your education is not yet complete; the higher
duties of men have not been yet presented to you fully.&nbsp; A
hint&mdash;till we have leisure&mdash;must suffice.&nbsp; Now
that I am once more in possession of a modest competence; now
that I have so long prepared myself in silent meditation, it
becomes my superior duty to proceed to Paris.&nbsp; My scientific
training, my undoubted command of language, mark me out for the
service of my country.&nbsp; Modesty in such a case would be a
snare.&nbsp; If sin were a philosophical expression, I should
call it sinful.&nbsp; A man must not deny his manifest abilities,
for that is to evade his obligations.&nbsp; I must be up and
doing; I must be no skulker in life&rsquo;s battle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he rattled on, copiously greasing the joint of his
inconsistency with words; while the boy listened silently, his
eyes fixed on the horse, his mind seething.&nbsp; It was all lost
eloquence; no array of words could unsettle a belief of
Jean-Marie&rsquo;s; and he drove into Fontainebleau filled with
pity, horror, indignation, and despair.</p>
<p>In the town Jean-Marie was kept a fixture on the driving-seat,
to guard the treasure; while the Doctor, with a singular,
slightly tipsy airiness of manner, fluttered in and out of
caf&eacute;s, where he shook hands with garrison officers, and
mixed an absinthe with the nicety of old experience; in and out
of shops, from which he returned laden with costly fruits, real
turtle, a magnificent piece of silk for his wife, a preposterous
cane for himself, and a kepi of the newest fashion for the boy;
in and out of the telegraph office, whence he despatched his
telegram, and where three hours later he received an answer
promising a visit on the morrow; and generally pervaded
Fontainebleau with the first fine aroma of his divine good
humour.</p>
<p>The sun was very low when they set forth again; the shadows of
the forest trees extended across the broad white road that led
them home; the penetrating odour of the evening wood had already
arisen, like a cloud of incense, from that broad field of
tree-tops; and even in the streets of the town, where the air had
been baked all day between white walls, it came in whiffs and
pulses, like a distant music.&nbsp; Half-way home, the last gold
flicker vanished from a great oak upon the left; and when they
came forth beyond the borders of the wood, the plain was already
sunken in pearly greyness, and a great, pale moon came swinging
skyward through the filmy poplars.</p>
<p>The Doctor sang, the Doctor whistled, the Doctor talked.&nbsp;
He spoke of the woods, and the wars, and the deposition of dew;
he brightened and babbled of Paris; he soared into cloudy bombast
on the glories of the political arena.&nbsp; All was to be
changed; as the day departed, it took with it the vestiges of an
outworn existence, and to-morrow&rsquo;s sun was to inaugurate
the new.&nbsp; &lsquo;Enough,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;of this
life of maceration!&rsquo;&nbsp; His wife (still beautiful, or he
was sadly partial) was to be no longer buried; she should now
shine before society.&nbsp; Jean-Marie would find the world at
his feet; the roads open to success, wealth, honour, and
post-humous renown.&nbsp; &lsquo;And O, by the way,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake keep your tongue quiet!&nbsp; You
are, of course, a very silent fellow; it is a quality I gladly
recognise in you&mdash;silence, golden silence!&nbsp; But this is
a matter of gravity.&nbsp; No word must get abroad; none but the
good Casimir is to be trusted; we shall probably dispose of the
vessels in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But are they not even ours?&rsquo; the boy said, almost
with a sob&mdash;it was the only time he had spoken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ours in this sense, that they are nobody
else&rsquo;s,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the
State would have some claim.&nbsp; If they were stolen, for
instance, we should be unable to demand their restitution; we
should have no title; we should be unable even to communicate
with the police.&nbsp; Such is the monstrous condition of the
law. <a name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a>&nbsp; It is a mere instance of what
remains to be done, of the injustices that may yet be righted by
an ardent, active, and philosophical deputy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jean-Marie put his faith in Madame Desprez; and as they drove
forward down the road from Bourron, between the rustling poplars,
he prayed in his teeth, and whipped up the horse to an unusual
speed.&nbsp; Surely, as soon as they arrived, madame would assert
her character, and bring this waking nightmare to an end.</p>
<p>Their entrance into Gretz was heralded and accompanied by a
most furious barking; all the dogs in the village seemed to smell
the treasure in the noddy.&nbsp; But there was no one in the
street, save three lounging landscape painters at
Tentaillon&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Jean-Marie opened the green gate
and led in the horse and carriage; and almost at the same moment
Madame Desprez came to the kitchen threshold with a lighted
lantern; for the moon was not yet high enough to clear the garden
walls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Close the gates, Jean-Marie!&rsquo; cried the Doctor,
somewhat unsteadily alighting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anastasie, where is
Aline?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has gone to Montereau to see her parents,&rsquo;
said madame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All is for the best!&rsquo; exclaimed the Doctor
fervently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, quick, come near to me; I do not
wish to speak too loud,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Darling, we are wealthy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wealthy!&rsquo; repeated the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found the treasure of Franchard,&rsquo; replied
her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, here are the first fruits; a
pineapple, a dress for my ever-beautiful&mdash;it will suit
her&mdash;trust a husband&rsquo;s, trust a lover&rsquo;s,
taste!&nbsp; Embrace me, darling!&nbsp; This grimy episode is
over; the butterfly unfolds its painted wings.&nbsp; To-morrow
Casimir will come; in a week we may be in Paris&mdash;happy at
last!&nbsp; You shall have diamonds.&nbsp; Jean-Marie, take it
out of the boot, with religious care, and bring it piece by piece
into the dining-room.&nbsp; We shall have plate at table!&nbsp;
Darling, hasten and prepare this turtle; it will be a
whet&mdash;it will be an addition to our meagre ordinary.&nbsp; I
myself will proceed to the cellar.&nbsp; We shall have a bottle
of that little Beaujolais you like, and finish with the
Hermitage; there are still three bottles left.&nbsp; Worthy wine
for a worthy occasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my husband; you put me in a whirl,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not comprehend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The turtle, my adored, the turtle!&rsquo; cried the
doctor; and he pushed her towards the kitchen, lantern and
all.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie stood dumfounded.&nbsp; He had pictured to himself
a different scene&mdash;a more immediate protest, and his hope
began to dwindle on the spot.</p>
<p>The Doctor was everywhere, a little doubtful on his legs,
perhaps, and now and then taking the wall with his shoulder; for
it was long since he had tasted absinthe, and he was even then
reflecting that the absinthe had been a misconception.&nbsp; Not
that he regretted excess on such a glorious day, but he made a
mental memorandum to beware; he must not, a second time, become
the victim of a deleterious habit.&nbsp; He had his wine out of
the cellar in a twinkling; he arranged the sacrificial vessels,
some on the white table-cloth, some on the sideboard, still
crusted with historic earth.&nbsp; He was in and out of the
kitchen, plying Anastasie with vermouth, heating her with
glimpses of the future, estimating their new wealth at ever
larger figures; and before they sat down to supper, the
lady&rsquo;s virtue had melted in the fire of his enthusiasm, her
timidity had disappeared; she, too, had begun to speak
disparagingly of the life at Gretz; and as she took her place and
helped the soup, her eyes shone with the glitter of prospective
diamonds.</p>
<p>All through the meal, she and the Doctor made and unmade fairy
plans.&nbsp; They bobbed and bowed and pledged each other.&nbsp;
Their faces ran over with smiles; their eyes scattered sparkles,
as they projected the Doctor&rsquo;s political honours and the
lady&rsquo;s drawing-room ovations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will not be a Red!&rsquo; cried Anastasie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am Left Centre to the core,&rsquo; replied the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame Gastein will present us&mdash;we shall find
ourselves forgotten,&rsquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; protested the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beauty
and talent leave a mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have positively forgotten how to dress,&rsquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Darling, you make me blush,&rsquo; cried he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yours has been a tragic marriage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your success&mdash;to see you appreciated,
honoured, your name in all the papers, that will be more than
pleasure&mdash;it will be heaven!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And once a week,&rsquo; said the Doctor, archly
scanning the syllables, &lsquo;once a week&mdash;one good little
game of baccarat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only once a week?&rsquo; she questioned, threatening
him with a finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear it by my political honour,&rsquo; cried he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I spoil you,&rsquo; she said, and gave him her
hand.</p>
<p>He covered it with kisses.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie escaped into the night.&nbsp; The moon swung high
over Gretz.&nbsp; He went down to the garden end and sat on the
jetty.&nbsp; The river ran by with eddies of oily silver, and a
low, monotonous song.&nbsp; Faint veils of mist moved among the
poplars on the farther side.&nbsp; The reeds were quietly
nodding.&nbsp; A hundred times already had the boy sat, on such a
night, and watched the streaming river with untroubled
fancy.&nbsp; And this perhaps was to be the last.&nbsp; He was to
leave this familiar hamlet, this green, rustling country, this
bright and quiet stream; he was to pass into the great city; his
dear lady mistress was to move bedizened in saloons; his good,
garrulous, kind-hearted master to become a brawling deputy; and
both be lost for ever to Jean-Marie and their better
selves.&nbsp; He knew his own defects; he knew he must sink into
less and less consideration in the turmoil of a city life, sink
more and more from the child into the servant.&nbsp; And he began
dimly to believe the Doctor&rsquo;s prophecies of evil.&nbsp; He
could see a change in both.&nbsp; His generous incredulity failed
him for this once; a child must have perceived that the Hermitage
had completed what the absinthe had begun.&nbsp; If this were the
first day, what would be the last?&nbsp; &lsquo;If necessary,
wreck the train,&rsquo; thought he, remembering the
Doctor&rsquo;s parable.&nbsp; He looked round on the delightful
scene; he drank deep of the charmed night air, laden with the
scent of hay.&nbsp; &lsquo;If necessary, wreck the train,&rsquo;
he repeated.&nbsp; And he rose and returned to the house.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, IN TWO
PARTS.</h3>
<p>The next morning there was a most unusual outcry, in the
Doctor&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The last thing before going to bed,
the Doctor had locked up some valuables in the dining-room
cupboard; and behold, when he rose again, as he did about four
o&rsquo;clock, the cupboard had been broken open, and the
valuables in question had disappeared.&nbsp; Madame and
Jean-Marie were summoned from their rooms, and appeared in hasty
toilets; they found the Doctor raving, calling the heavens to
witness and avenge his injury, pacing the room bare-footed, with
the tails of his night-shirt flirting as he turned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the things are gone, the
fortune gone!&nbsp; We are paupers once more.&nbsp; Boy! what do
you know of this?&nbsp; Speak up, sir, speak up.&nbsp; Do you
know of it?&nbsp; Where are they?&rsquo;&nbsp; He had him by the
arm, shaking him like a bag, and the boy&rsquo;s words, if he had
any, were jolted forth in inarticulate murmurs.&nbsp; The Doctor,
with a revulsion from his own violence, set him down again.&nbsp;
He observed Anastasie in tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anastasie,&rsquo; he
said, in quite an altered voice, &lsquo;compose yourself, command
your feelings.&nbsp; I would not have you give way to passion
like the vulgar.&nbsp; This&mdash;this trifling accident must be
lived down.&nbsp; Jean-Marie, bring me my smaller medicine
chest.&nbsp; A gentle laxative is indicated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he dosed the family all round, leading the way himself
with a double quantity.&nbsp; The wretched Anastasie, who had
never been ill in the whole course of her existence, and whose
soul recoiled from remedies, wept floods of tears as she sipped,
and shuddered, and protested, and then was bullied and shouted at
until she sipped again.&nbsp; As for Jean-Marie, he took his
portion down with stoicism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have given him a less amount,&rsquo; observed the
Doctor, &lsquo;his youth protecting him against emotion.&nbsp;
And now that we have thus parried any morbid consequences, let us
reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so cold,&rsquo; wailed Anastasie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cold!&rsquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I give
thanks to God that I am made of fierier material.&nbsp; Why,
madam, a blow like this would set a frog into a
transpiration.&nbsp; If you are cold, you can retire; and, by the
way, you might throw me down my trousers.&nbsp; It is chilly for
the legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; protested Anastasie; &lsquo;I will stay
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, madam, you shall not suffer for your
devotion,&rsquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will myself
fetch you a shawl.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he went upstairs and returned
more fully clad and with an armful of wraps for the shivering
Anastasie.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;to
investigate this crime.&nbsp; Let us proceed by induction.&nbsp;
Anastasie, do you know anything that can help us?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Anastasie knew nothing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or you,
Jean-Marie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; replied the boy steadily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; returned the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall
now turn our attention to the material evidences.&nbsp; (I was
born to be a detective; I have the eye and the systematic
spirit.)&nbsp; First, violence has been employed.&nbsp; The door
was broken open; and it may be observed, in passing, that the
lock was dear indeed at what I paid for it: a crow to pluck with
Master Goguelat.&nbsp; Second, here is the instrument employed,
one of our own table-knives, one of our best, my dear; which
seems to indicate no preparation on the part of the gang&mdash;if
gang it was.&nbsp; Thirdly, I observe that nothing has been
removed except the Franchard dishes and the casket; our own
silver has been minutely respected.&nbsp; This is wily; it shows
intelligence, a knowledge of the code, a desire to avoid legal
consequences.&nbsp; I argue from this fact that the gang numbers
persons of respectability&mdash;outward, of course, and merely
outward, as the robbery proves.&nbsp; But I argue, second, that
we must have been observed at Franchard itself by some occult
observer, and dogged throughout the day with a skill and patience
that I venture to qualify as consummate.&nbsp; No ordinary man,
no occasional criminal, would have shown himself capable of this
combination.&nbsp; We have in our neighbourhood, it is far from
improbable, a retired bandit of the highest order of
intelligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heaven!&rsquo; cried the horrified
Anastasie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Henri, how can you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cherished one, this is a process of
induction,&rsquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any of my
steps are unsound, correct me.&nbsp; You are silent?&nbsp; Then
do not, I beseech you, be so vulgarly illogical as to revolt from
my conclusion.&nbsp; We have now arrived,&rsquo; he resumed,
&lsquo;at some idea of the composition of the gang&mdash;for I
incline to the hypothesis of more than one&mdash;and we now leave
this room, which can disclose no more, and turn our attention to
the court and garden.&nbsp; (Jean-Marie, I trust you are
observantly following my various steps; this is an excellent
piece of education for you.)&nbsp; Come with me to the
door.&nbsp; No steps on the court; it is unfortunate our court
should be paved.&nbsp; On what small matters hang the destiny of
these delicate investigations!&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; What have we
here?&nbsp; I have led on to the very spot,&rsquo; he said,
standing grandly backward and indicating the green gate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An escalade, as you can now see for yourselves, has taken
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the green paint was in several places scratched
and broken; and one of the panels preserved the print of a nailed
shoe.&nbsp; The foot had slipped, however, and it was difficult
to estimate the size of the shoe, and impossible to distinguish
the pattern of the nails.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The whole robbery,&rsquo; concluded the Doctor,
&lsquo;step by step, has been reconstituted.&nbsp; Inductive
science can no further go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is wonderful,&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
should indeed have been a detective, Henri.&nbsp; I had no idea
of your talents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; replied Desprez, condescendingly,
&lsquo;a man of scientific imagination combines the lesser
faculties; he is a detective just as he is a publicist or a
general; these are but local applications of his special
talent.&nbsp; But now,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;would you have
me go further?&nbsp; Would you have me lay my finger on the
culprits&mdash;or rather, for I cannot promise quite so much,
point out to you the very house where they consort?&nbsp; It may
be a satisfaction, at least it is all we are likely to get, since
we are denied the remedy of law.&nbsp; I reach the further stage
in this way.&nbsp; In order to fill my outline of the robbery, I
require a man likely to be in the forest idling, I require a man
of education, I require a man superior to considerations of
morality.&nbsp; The three requisites all centre in
Tentaillon&rsquo;s boarders.&nbsp; They are painters, therefore
they are continually lounging in the forest.&nbsp; They are
painters, therefore they are not unlikely to have some smattering
of education.&nbsp; Lastly, because they are painters, they are
probably immoral.&nbsp; And this I prove in two ways.&nbsp;
First, painting is an art which merely addresses the eye; it does
not in any particular exercise the moral sense.&nbsp; And second,
painting, in common with all the other arts, implies the
dangerous quality of imagination.&nbsp; A man of imagination is
never moral; he outsoars literal demarcations and reviews life
under too many shifting lights to rest content with the invidious
distinctions of the law!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you always say&mdash;at least, so I understood
you&rsquo;&mdash;said madame, &lsquo;that these lads display no
imagination whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, they displayed imagination, and of a very
fantastic order, too,&rsquo; returned the Doctor, &lsquo;when
they embraced their beggarly profession.&nbsp; Besides&mdash;and
this is an argument exactly suited to your intellectual
level&mdash;many of them are English and American.&nbsp; Where
else should we expect to find a thief?&mdash;And now you had
better get your coffee.&nbsp; Because we have lost a treasure,
there is no reason for starving.&nbsp; For my part, I shall break
my fast with white wine.&nbsp; I feel unaccountably heated and
thirsty to-day.&nbsp; I can only attribute it to the shock of the
discovery.&nbsp; And yet, you will bear me out, I supported the
emotion nobly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor had now talked himself back into an admirable
humour; and as he sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed a large
allowance of white wine and picked a little bread and cheese with
no very impetuous appetite, if a third of his meditations ran
upon the missing treasure, the other two-thirds were more
pleasingly busied in the retrospect of his detective skill.</p>
<p>About eleven Casimir arrived; he had caught an early train to
Fontainebleau, and driven over to save time; and now his cab was
stabled at Tentaillon&rsquo;s, and he remarked, studying his
watch, that he could spare an hour and a half.&nbsp; He was much
the man of business, decisively spoken, given to frowning in an
intellectual manner.&nbsp; Anastasie&rsquo;s born brother, he did
not waste much sentiment on the lady, gave her an English family
kiss, and demanded a meal without delay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can tell me your story while we eat,&rsquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anything good to-day, Stasie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was promised something good.&nbsp; The trio sat down to
table in the arbour, Jean-Marie waiting as well as eating, and
the Doctor recounted what had happened in his richest narrative
manner.&nbsp; Casimir heard it with explosions of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a streak of luck for you, my good brother,&rsquo;
he observed, when the tale was over.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you had gone
to Paris, you would have played dick-duck-drake with the whole
consignment in three months.&nbsp; Your own would have followed;
and you would have come to me in a procession like the last
time.&nbsp; But I give you warning&mdash;Stasie may weep and
Henri ratiocinate&mdash;it will not serve you twice.&nbsp; Your
next collapse will be fatal.&nbsp; I thought I had told you so,
Stasie?&nbsp; Hey?&nbsp; No sense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor winced and looked furtively at Jean-Marie; but the
boy seemed apathetic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then again,&rsquo; broke out Casimir, &lsquo;what
children you are&mdash;vicious children, my faith!&nbsp; How
could you tell the value of this trash?&nbsp; It might have been
worth nothing, or next door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have your usual flow of spirits, I perceive, but even less than
your usual deliberation.&nbsp; I am not entirely ignorant of
these matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not entirely ignorant of anything ever I heard
of,&rsquo; interrupted Casimir, bowing, and raising his glass
with a sort of pert politeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least,&rsquo; resumed the Doctor, &lsquo;I gave my
mind to the subject&mdash;that you may be willing to
believe&mdash;and I estimated that our capital would be
doubled.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he described the nature of the
find.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My word of honour!&rsquo; said Casimir, &lsquo;I half
believe you!&nbsp; But much would depend on the quality of the
gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The quality, my dear Casimir, was&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the Doctor, in default of language, kissed his
finger-tips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not take your word for it, my good
friend,&rsquo; retorted the man of business.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are
a man of very rosy views.&nbsp; But this robbery,&rsquo; he
continued&mdash;&lsquo;this robbery is an odd thing.&nbsp; Of
course I pass over your nonsense about gangs and
landscape-painters.&nbsp; For me, that is a dream.&nbsp; Who was
in the house last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None but ourselves,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this young gentleman?&rsquo; asked Casimir, jerking
a nod in the direction of Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He too&rsquo;&mdash;the Doctor bowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; and if it is a fair question, who is he?&rsquo;
pursued the brother-in-law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie,&rsquo; answered the Doctor, &lsquo;combines
the functions of a son and stable-boy.&nbsp; He began as the
latter, but he rose rapidly to the more honourable rank in our
affections.&nbsp; He is, I may say, the greatest comfort in our
lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;And previous to
becoming one of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie has lived a remarkable existence; his
experience his been eminently formative,&rsquo; replied
Desprez.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had had to choose an education for my
son, I should have chosen such another.&nbsp; Beginning life with
mountebanks and thieves, passing onward to the society and
friendship of philosophers, he may be said to have skimmed the
volume of human life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thieves?&rsquo; repeated the brother-in-law, with a
meditative air.</p>
<p>The Doctor could have bitten his tongue out.&nbsp; He foresaw
what was coming, and prepared his mind for a vigorous
defence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever steal yourself?&rsquo; asked Casimir,
turning suddenly on Jean-Marie, and for the first time employing
a single eyeglass which hung round his neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied the boy, with a deep
blush.</p>
<p>Casimir turned to the others with pursed lips, and nodded to
them meaningly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hey?&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;how is
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie is a teller of the truth,&rsquo; returned
the Doctor, throwing out his bust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has never told a lie,&rsquo; added madame.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is the best of boys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never told a lie, has he not?&rsquo; reflected
Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strange, very strange.&nbsp; Give me your
attention, my young friend,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
knew about this treasure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He helped to bring it home,&rsquo; interposed the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Desprez, I ask you nothing but to hold your
tongue,&rsquo; returned Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mean to question
this stable-boy of yours; and if you are so certain of his
innocence, you can afford to let him answer for himself.&nbsp;
Now, sir,&rsquo; he resumed, pointing his eyeglass straight at
Jean-Marie.&nbsp; &lsquo;You knew it could be stolen with
impunity?&nbsp; You knew you could not be prosecuted?&nbsp;
Come!&nbsp; Did you, or did you not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; answered Jean-Marie, in a miserable
whisper.&nbsp; He sat there changing colour like a revolving
pharos, twisting his fingers hysterically, swallowing air, the
picture of guilt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You knew where it was put?&rsquo; resumed the
inquisitor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; from Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say you have been a thief before,&rsquo; continued
Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now how am I to know that you are not one
still?&nbsp; I suppose you could climb the green gate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; still lower, from the culprit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, it was you who stole these things.&nbsp;
You know it, and you dare not deny it.&nbsp; Look me in the
face!&nbsp; Raise your sneak&rsquo;s eyes, and answer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But in place of anything of that sort Jean-Marie broke into a
dismal howl and fled from the arbour.&nbsp; Anastasie, as she
pursued to capture and reassure the victim, found time to send
one Parthian arrow&mdash;&lsquo;Casimir, you are a
brute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother,&rsquo; said Desprez, with the greatest
dignity, &lsquo;you take upon yourself a
licence&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Desprez,&rsquo; interrupted Casimir, &lsquo;for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake be a man of the world.&nbsp; You telegraph me
to leave my business and come down here on yours.&nbsp; I come, I
ask the business, you say &ldquo;Find me this thief!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, I find him; I say &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;&nbsp; You need
not like it, but you have no manner of right to take
offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned the Doctor, &lsquo;I grant that;
I will even thank you for your mistaken zeal.&nbsp; But your
hypothesis was so extravagantly monstrous&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; interrupted Casimir; &lsquo;was it
you or Stasie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; answered the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; then it was the boy.&nbsp; Say no more about
it,&rsquo; said the brother-in-law, and he produced his
cigar-case.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will say this much more,&rsquo; returned Desprez:
&lsquo;if that boy came and told me so himself, I should not
believe him; and if I did believe him, so implicit is my trust, I
should conclude that he had acted for the best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Casimir, indulgently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you a light?&nbsp; I must be going.&nbsp; And by the
way, I wish you would let me sell your Turks for you.&nbsp; I
always told you, it meant smash.&nbsp; I tell you so again.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was partly that that brought me down.&nbsp; You never
acknowledge my letters&mdash;a most unpardonable
habit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good brother,&rsquo; replied the Doctor blandly,
&lsquo;I have never denied your ability in business; but I can
perceive your limitations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Egad, my friend, I can return the compliment,&rsquo;
observed the man of business.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your limitation is to
be downright irrational.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Observe the relative position,&rsquo; returned the
Doctor with a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is your attitude to believe
through thick and thin in one man&rsquo;s judgment&mdash;your
own.&nbsp; I follow the same opinion, but critically and with
open eyes.&nbsp; Which is the more irrational?&mdash;I leave it
to yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my dear fellow!&rsquo; cried Casimir, &lsquo;stick
to your Turks, stick to your stable-boy, go to the devil in
general in your own way and be done with it.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t ratiocinate with me&mdash;I cannot bear it.&nbsp; And
so, ta-ta.&nbsp; I might as well have stayed away for any good
I&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; Say good-bye from me to Stasie, and to the
sullen hang-dog of a stable-boy, if you insist on it; I&rsquo;m
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Casimir departed.&nbsp; The Doctor, that night, dissected
his character before Anastasie.&nbsp; &lsquo;One thing, my
beautiful,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he has learned one thing from
his lifelong acquaintance with your husband: the word
<i>ratiocinate</i>.&nbsp; It shines in his vocabulary, like a
jewel in a muck-heap.&nbsp; And, even so, he continually
misapplies it.&nbsp; For you must have observed he uses it as a
sort of taunt, in the sense of to <i>ergotise</i>, implying, as
it were&mdash;the poor, dear fellow!&mdash;a vein of
sophistry.&nbsp; As for his cruelty to Jean-Marie, it must be
forgiven him&mdash;it is not his nature, it is the nature of his
life.&nbsp; A man who deals with money, my dear, is a man
lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With Jean-Marie the process of reconciliation had been
somewhat slow.&nbsp; At first he was inconsolable, insisted on
leaving the family, went from paroxysm to paroxysm of tears; and
it was only after Anastasie had been closeted for an hour with
him, alone, that she came forth, sought out the Doctor, and, with
tears in her eyes, acquainted that gentleman with what had
passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first, my husband, he would hear of nothing,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Imagine! if he had left us! what would the
treasure be to that?&nbsp; Horrible treasure, it has brought all
this about!&nbsp; At last, after he has sobbed his very heart
out, he agrees to stay on a condition&mdash;we are not to mention
this matter, this infamous suspicion, not even to mention the
robbery.&nbsp; On that agreement only, the poor, cruel boy will
consent to remain among his friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this inhibition,&rsquo; said the Doctor,
&lsquo;this embargo&mdash;it cannot possibly apply to
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To all of us,&rsquo; Anastasie assured him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cherished one,&rsquo; Desprez protested, &lsquo;you
must have misunderstood.&nbsp; It cannot apply to me.&nbsp; He
would naturally come to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henri,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it does; I swear to you
it does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a painful, a very painful circumstance,&rsquo;
the Doctor said, looking a little black.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot
affect, Anastasie, to be anything but justly wounded.&nbsp; I
feel this, I feel it, my wife, acutely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you would,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if
you had seen his distress!&nbsp; We must make allowances, we must
sacrifice our feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust, my dear, you have never found me averse to
sacrifices,&rsquo; returned the Doctor very stiffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will let me go and tell him that you have
agreed?&nbsp; It will be like your noble nature,&rsquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>So it would, he perceived&mdash;it would be like his noble
nature!&nbsp; Up jumped his spirits, triumphant at the
thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go, darling,&rsquo; he said nobly,
&lsquo;reassure him.&nbsp; The subject is buried; more&mdash;I
make an effort, I have accustomed my will to these
exertions&mdash;and it is forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little after, but still with swollen eyes and looking
mortally sheepish, Jean-Marie reappeared and went ostentatiously
about his business.&nbsp; He was the only unhappy member of the
party that sat down that night to supper.&nbsp; As for the
Doctor, he was radiant.&nbsp; He thus sang the requiem of the
treasure:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This has been, on the whole, a most amusing
episode,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are not a penny the
worse&mdash;nay, we are immensely gainers.&nbsp; Our philosophy
has been exercised; some of the turtle is still left&mdash;the
most wholesome of delicacies; I have my staff, Anastasie has her
new dress, Jean-Marie is the proud possessor of a fashionable
kepi.&nbsp; Besides, we had a glass of Hermitage last night; the
glow still suffuses my memory.&nbsp; I was growing positively
niggardly with that Hermitage, positively niggardly.&nbsp; Let me
take the hint: we had one bottle to celebrate the appearance of
our visionary fortune; let us have a second to console us for its
occultation.&nbsp; The third I hereby dedicate to
Jean-Marie&rsquo;s wedding breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF DESPREZ.</h3>
<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s house has not yet received the compliment
of a description, and it is now high time that the omission were
supplied, for the house is itself an actor in the story, and one
whose part is nearly at an end.&nbsp; Two stories in height,
walls of a warm yellow, tiles of an ancient ruddy brown
diversified with moss and lichen, it stood with one wall to the
street in the angle of the Doctor&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; It was
roomy, draughty, and inconvenient.&nbsp; The large rafters were
here and there engraven with rude marks and patterns; the
handrail of the stair was carved in countrified arabesque; a
stout timber pillar, which did duty to support the dining-room
roof, bore mysterious characters on its darker side, runes,
according to the Doctor; nor did he fail, when he ran over the
legendary history of the house and its possessors, to dwell upon
the Scandinavian scholar who had left them.&nbsp; Floors, doors,
and rafters made a great variety of angles; every room had a
particular inclination; the gable had tilted towards the garden,
after the manner of a leaning tower, and one of the former
proprietors had buttressed the building from that side with a
great strut of wood, like the derrick of a crane.&nbsp;
Altogether, it had many marks of ruin; it was a house for the
rats to desert; and nothing but its excellent
brightness&mdash;the window-glass polished and shining, the paint
well scoured, the brasses radiant, the very prop all wreathed
about with climbing flowers&mdash;nothing but its air of a
well-tended, smiling veteran, sitting, crutch and all, in the
sunny corner of a garden, marked it as a house for comfortable
people to inhabit.&nbsp; In poor or idle management it would soon
have hurried into the blackguard stages of decay.&nbsp; As it
was, the whole family loved it, and the Doctor was never better
inspired than when he narrated its imaginary story and drew the
character of its successive masters, from the Hebrew merchant who
had re-edified its walls after the sack of the town, and past the
mysterious engraver of the runes, down to the long-headed,
dirty-handed boor from whom he had himself acquired it at a
ruinous expense.&nbsp; As for any alarm about its security, the
idea had never presented itself.&nbsp; What had stood four
centuries might well endure a little longer.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this particular winter, after the finding and
losing of the treasure, the Desprez&rsquo; had an anxiety of a
very different order, and one which lay nearer their
hearts.&nbsp; Jean-Marie was plainly not himself.&nbsp; He had
fits of hectic activity, when he made unusual exertions to
please, spoke more and faster, and redoubled in attention to his
lessons.&nbsp; But these were interrupted by spells of
melancholia and brooding silence, when the boy was little better
than unbearable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence,&rsquo; the Doctor moralised&mdash;&lsquo;you
see, Anastasie, what comes of silence.&nbsp; Had the boy properly
unbosomed himself, the little disappointment about the treasure,
the little annoyance about Casimir&rsquo;s incivility, would long
ago have been forgotten.&nbsp; As it is, they prey upon him like
a disease.&nbsp; He loses flesh, his appetite is variable and, on
the whole, impaired.&nbsp; I keep him on the strictest regimen, I
exhibit the most powerful tonics; both in vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you drug him too much?&rsquo;
asked madame, with an irrepressible shudder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drug?&rsquo; cried the Doctor; &lsquo;I drug?&nbsp;
Anastasie, you are mad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Time went on, and the boy&rsquo;s health still slowly
declined.&nbsp; The Doctor blamed the weather, which was cold and
boisterous.&nbsp; He called in his <i>confr&egrave;re</i> from
Bourron, took a fancy for him, magnified his capacity, and was
pretty soon under treatment himself&mdash;it scarcely appeared
for what complaint.&nbsp; He and Jean-Marie had each medicine to
take at different periods of the day.&nbsp; The Doctor used to
lie in wait for the exact moment, watch in hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is nothing like regularity,&rsquo; he would say,
fill out the doses, and dilate on the virtues of the draught; and
if the boy seemed none the better, the Doctor was not at all the
worse.</p>
<p>Gunpowder Day, the boy was particularly low.&nbsp; It was
scowling, squally weather.&nbsp; Huge broken companies of cloud
sailed swiftly overhead; raking gleams of sunlight swept the
village, and were followed by intervals of darkness and white,
flying rain.&nbsp; At times the wind lifted up its voice and
bellowed.&nbsp; The trees were all scourging themselves along the
meadows, the last leaves flying like dust.</p>
<p>The Doctor, between the boy and the weather, was in his
element; he had a theory to prove.&nbsp; He sat with his watch
out and a barometer in front of him, waiting for the squalls and
noting their effect upon the human pulse.&nbsp; &lsquo;For the
true philosopher,&rsquo; he remarked delightedly, &lsquo;every
fact in nature is a toy.&rsquo;&nbsp; A letter came to him; but,
as its arrival coincided with the approach of another gust, he
merely crammed it into his pocket, gave the time to Jean-Marie,
and the next moment they were both counting their pulses as if
for a wager.</p>
<p>At nightfall the wind rose into a tempest.&nbsp; It besieged
the hamlet, apparently from every side, as if with batteries of
cannon; the houses shook and groaned; live coals were blown upon
the floor.&nbsp; The uproar and terror of the night kept people
long awake, sitting with pallid faces giving ear.</p>
<p>It was twelve before the Desprez family retired.&nbsp; By
half-past one, when the storm was already somewhat past its
height, the Doctor was awakened from a troubled slumber, and sat
up.&nbsp; A noise still rang in his ears, but whether of this
world or the world of dreams he was not certain.&nbsp; Another
clap of wind followed.&nbsp; It was accompanied by a sickening
movement of the whole house, and in the subsequent lull Desprez
could hear the tiles pouring like a cataract into the loft above
his head.&nbsp; He plucked Anastasie bodily out of bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Run!&rsquo; he cried, thrusting some wearing apparel
into her hands; &lsquo;the house is falling!&nbsp; To the
garden!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not pause to be twice bidden; she was down the stair
in an instant.&nbsp; She had never before suspected herself of
such activity.&nbsp; The Doctor meanwhile, with the speed of a
piece of pantomime business, and undeterred by broken shins,
proceeded to rout out Jean-Marie, tore Aline from her virgin
slumbers, seized her by the hand, and tumbled downstairs and into
the garden, with the girl tumbling behind him, still not half
awake.</p>
<p>The fugitives rendezvous&rsquo;d in the arbour by some common
instinct.&nbsp; Then came a bull&rsquo;s-eye flash of struggling
moonshine, which disclosed their four figures standing huddled
from the wind in a raffle of flying drapery, and not without a
considerable need for more.&nbsp; At the humiliating spectacle
Anastasie clutched her nightdress desperately about her and burst
loudly into tears.&nbsp; The Doctor flew to console her; but she
elbowed him away.&nbsp; She suspected everybody of being the
general public, and thought the darkness was alive with eyes.</p>
<p>Another gleam and another violent gust arrived together; the
house was seen to rock on its foundation, and, just as the light
was once more eclipsed, a crash which triumphed over the shouting
of the wind announced its fall, and for a moment the whole garden
was alive with skipping tiles and brickbats.&nbsp; One such
missile grazed the Doctor&rsquo;s ear; another descended on the
bare foot of Aline, who instantly made night hideous with her
shrieks.</p>
<p>By this time the hamlet was alarmed, lights flashed from the
windows, hails reached the party, and the Doctor answered, nobly
contending against Aline and the tempest.&nbsp; But this prospect
of help only awakened Anastasie to a more active stage of
terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henri, people will be coming,&rsquo; she screamed in
her husband&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust so,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They cannot.&nbsp; I would rather die,&rsquo; she
wailed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said the Doctor reprovingly, &lsquo;you
are excited.&nbsp; I gave you some clothes.&nbsp; What have you
done with them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I must have thrown them
away!&nbsp; Where are they?&rsquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>Desprez groped about in the darkness.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Admirable!&rsquo; he remarked; &lsquo;my grey velveteen
trousers!&nbsp; This will exactly meet your
necessities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give them to me!&rsquo; she cried fiercely; but as soon
as she had them in her hands her mood appeared to alter&mdash;she
stood silent for a moment, and then pressed the garment back upon
the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give it to Aline,&rsquo; she
said&mdash;&lsquo;poor girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aline
does not know what she is about.&nbsp; Aline is beside herself
with terror; and at any rate, she is a peasant.&nbsp; Now I am
really concerned at this exposure for a person of your
housekeeping habits; my solicitude and your fantastic modesty
both point to the same remedy&mdash;the pantaloons.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He held them ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is impossible.&nbsp; You do not understand,&rsquo;
she said with dignity.</p>
<p>By this time rescue was at hand.&nbsp; It had been found
impracticable to enter by the street, for the gate was blocked
with masonry, and the nodding ruin still threatened further
avalanches.&nbsp; But between the Doctor&rsquo;s garden and the
one on the right hand there was that very picturesque
contrivance&mdash;a common well; the door on the Desprez&rsquo;
side had chanced to be unbolted, and now, through the arched
aperture a man&rsquo;s bearded face and an arm supporting a
lantern were introduced into the world of windy darkness, where
Anastasie concealed her woes.&nbsp; The light struck here and
there among the tossing apple boughs, it glinted on the grass;
but the lantern and the glowing face became the centre of the
world.&nbsp; Anastasie crouched back from the intrusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This way!&rsquo; shouted the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you
all safe?&rsquo;&nbsp; Aline, still screaming, ran to the new
comer, and was presently hauled head-foremost through the
wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Anastasie, come on; it is your turn,&rsquo; said
the husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we all to die of exposure, madame?&rsquo; thundered
Doctor Desprez.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can go!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, go, go
away!&nbsp; I can stay here; I am quite warm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor took her by the shoulders with an oath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; she screamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will put them
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took the detested lendings in her hand once more; but her
repulsion was stronger than shame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; she
cried, shuddering, and flung them far away into the night.</p>
<p>Next moment the Doctor had whirled her to the well.&nbsp; The
man was there and the lantern; Anastasie closed her eyes and
appeared to herself to be about to die.&nbsp; How she was
transported through the arch she knew not; but once on the other
side she was received by the neighbour&rsquo;s wife, and
enveloped in a friendly blanket.</p>
<p>Beds were made ready for the two women, clothes of very
various sizes for the Doctor and Jean-Marie; and for the
remainder of the night, while madame dozed in and out on the
borderland of hysterics, her husband sat beside the fire and held
forth to the admiring neighbours.&nbsp; He showed them, at
length, the causes of the accident; for years, he explained, the
fall had been impending; one sign had followed another, the
joints had opened, the plaster had cracked, the old walls bowed
inward; last, not three weeks ago, the cellar door had begun to
work with difficulty in its grooves.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
cellar!&rsquo; he said, gravely shaking his head over a glass of
mulled wine.&nbsp; &lsquo;That reminds me of my poor
vintages.&nbsp; By a manifest providence the Hermitage was nearly
at an end.&nbsp; One bottle&mdash;I lose but one bottle of that
incomparable wine.&nbsp; It had been set apart against
Jean-Marie&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; Well, I must lay down some
more; it will be an interest in life.&nbsp; I am, however, a man
somewhat advanced in years.&nbsp; My great work is now buried in
the fall of my humble roof; it will never be completed&mdash;my
name will have been writ in water.&nbsp; And yet you find me
calm&mdash;I would say cheerful.&nbsp; Can your priest do
more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the first glimpse of day the party sallied forth from the
fireside into the street.&nbsp; The wind had fallen, but still
charioted a world of troubled clouds; the air bit like frost; and
the party, as they stood about the ruins in the rainy twilight of
the morning, beat upon their breasts and blew into their hands
for warmth.&nbsp; The house had entirely fallen, the walls
outward, the roof in; it was a mere heap of rubbish, with here
and there a forlorn spear of broken rafter.&nbsp; A sentinel was
placed over the ruins to protect the property, and the party
adjourned to Tentaillon&rsquo;s to break their fast at the
Doctor&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; The bottle circulated somewhat
freely; and before they left the table it had begun to snow.</p>
<p>For three days the snow continued to fall, and the ruins,
covered with tarpaulin and watched by sentries, were left
undisturbed.&nbsp; The Desprez&rsquo; meanwhile had taken up
their abode at Tentaillon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Madame spent her time in
the kitchen, concocting little delicacies, with the admiring aid
of Madame Tentaillon, or sitting by the fire in thoughtful
abstraction.&nbsp; The fall of the house affected her wonderfully
little; that blow had been parried by another; and in her mind
she was continually fighting over again the battle of the
trousers.&nbsp; Had she done right?&nbsp; Had she done
wrong?&nbsp; And now she would applaud her determination; and
anon, with a horrid flush of unavailing penitence, she would
regret the trousers.&nbsp; No juncture in her life had so much
exercised her judgment.&nbsp; In the meantime the Doctor had
become vastly pleased with his situation.&nbsp; Two of the summer
boarders still lingered behind the rest, prisoners for lack of a
remittance; they were both English, but one of them spoke French
pretty fluently, and was, besides, a humorous, agile-minded
fellow, with whom the Doctor could reason by the hour, secure of
comprehension.&nbsp; Many were the glasses they emptied, many the
topics they discussed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anastasie,&rsquo; the Doctor said on the third morning,
&lsquo;take an example from your husband, from Jean-Marie!&nbsp;
The excitement has done more for the boy than all my tonics, he
takes his turn as sentry with positive gusto.&nbsp; As for me,
you behold me.&nbsp; I have made friends with the Egyptians; and
my Pharaoh is, I swear it, a most agreeable companion.&nbsp; You
alone are hipped.&nbsp; About a house&mdash;a few dresses?&nbsp;
What are they in comparison to the
&ldquo;Pharmacopoeia&rdquo;&mdash;the labour of years lying
buried below stones and sticks in this depressing hamlet?&nbsp;
The snow falls; I shake it from my cloak!&nbsp; Imitate me.&nbsp;
Our income will be impaired, I grant it, since we must rebuild;
but moderation, patience, and philosophy will gather about the
hearth.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the Tentaillons are obliging; the
table, with your additions, will pass; only the wine is
execrable&mdash;well, I shall send for some to-day.&nbsp; My
Pharaoh will be gratified to drink a decent glass; aha! and I
shall see if he possesses that acme of organisation&mdash;a
palate.&nbsp; If he has a palate, he is perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henri,&rsquo; she said, shaking her head, &lsquo;you
are a man; you cannot understand my feelings; no woman could
shake off the memory of so public a humiliation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Doctor could not restrain a titter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pardon me,
darling,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but really, to the philosophical
intelligence, the incident appears so small a trifle.&nbsp; You
looked extremely well&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henri!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, I will say no more,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though, to be sure, if you had consented to
indue&mdash;<i>&Agrave; propos</i>,&rsquo; he broke off,
&lsquo;and my trousers!&nbsp; They are lying in the snow&mdash;my
favourite trousers!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he dashed in quest of
Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>Two hours afterwards the boy returned to the inn with a spade
under one arm and a curious sop of clothing under the other.</p>
<p>The Doctor ruefully took it in his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
have been!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Their tense is
past.&nbsp; Excellent pantaloons, you are no more!&nbsp; Stay,
something in the pocket,&rsquo; and he produced a piece of
paper.&nbsp; &lsquo;A letter! ay, now I mind me; it was received
on the morning of the gale, when I was absorbed in delicate
investigations.&nbsp; It is still legible.&nbsp; From poor, dear
Casimir!&nbsp; It is as well,&rsquo; he chuckled, &lsquo;that I
have educated him to patience.&nbsp; Poor Casimir and his
correspondence&mdash;his infinitesimal, timorous, idiotic
correspondence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had by this time cautiously unfolded the wet letter; but,
as he bent himself to decipher the writing, a cloud descended on
his brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Bigre</i>!&rsquo; he cried, with a galvanic
start.</p>
<p>And then the letter was whipped into the fire, and the
Doctor&rsquo;s cap was on his head in the turn of a hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten minutes!&nbsp; I can catch it, if I run,&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is always late.&nbsp; I go to Paris.&nbsp;
I shall telegraph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henri! what is wrong?&rsquo; cried his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ottoman Bonds!&rsquo; came from the disappearing
Doctor; and Anastasie and Jean-Marie were left face to face with
the wet trousers.&nbsp; Desprez had gone to Paris, for the second
time in seven years; he had gone to Paris with a pair of wooden
shoes, a knitted spencer, a black blouse, a country nightcap, and
twenty francs in his pocket.&nbsp; The fall of the house was but
a secondary marvel; the whole world might have fallen and scarce
left his family more petrified.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII. THE WAGES OF PHILOSOPHY.</h3>
<p>On the morning of the next day, the Doctor, a mere spectre of
himself, was brought back in the custody of Casimir.&nbsp; They
found Anastasie and the boy sitting together by the fire; and
Desprez, who had exchanged his toilette for a ready-made rig-out
of poor materials, waved his hand as he entered, and sank
speechless on the nearest chair.&nbsp; Madame turned direct to
Casimir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is wrong?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Casimir, &lsquo;what have I told
you all along?&nbsp; It has come.&nbsp; It is a clean shave, this
time; so you may as well bear up and make the best of it.&nbsp;
House down, too, eh?&nbsp; Bad luck, upon my soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we&mdash;are we&mdash;ruined?&rsquo; she
gasped.</p>
<p>The Doctor stretched out his arms to her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ruined,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;you are ruined by your
sinister husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Casimir observed the consequent embrace through his eyeglass;
then he turned to Jean-Marie.&nbsp; &lsquo;You hear?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are ruined; no more pickings, no more
house, no more fat cutlets.&nbsp; It strikes me, my friend, that
you had best be packing; the present speculation is about worked
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he nodded to him meaningly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; cried Desprez, springing up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jean-Marie, if you prefer to leave me, now that I am poor,
you can go; you shall receive your hundred francs, if so much
remains to me.&nbsp; But if you will consent to
stay&rsquo;&mdash;the Doctor wept a little&mdash;&lsquo;Casimir
offers me a place&mdash;as clerk,&rsquo; he resumed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The emoluments are slender, but they will be enough for
three.&nbsp; It is too much already to have lost my fortune; must
I lose my son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jean-Marie sobbed bitterly, but without a word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like boys who cry,&rsquo; observed
Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;This one is always crying.&nbsp; Here! you
clear out of this for a little; I have business with your master
and mistress, and these domestic feelings may be settled after I
am gone.&nbsp; March!&rsquo; and he held the door open.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie slunk out, like a detected thief.</p>
<p>By twelve they were all at table but Jean-Marie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey?&rsquo; said Casimir.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone, you
see.&nbsp; Took the hint at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not, I confess,&rsquo; said Desprez, &lsquo;I do
not seek to excuse his absence.&nbsp; It speaks a want of heart
that disappoints me sorely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Want of manners,&rsquo; corrected Casimir.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Heart, he never had.&nbsp; Why, Desprez, for a clever
fellow, you are the most gullible mortal in creation.&nbsp; Your
ignorance of human nature and human business is beyond
belief.&nbsp; You are swindled by heathen Turks, swindled by
vagabond children, swindled right and left, upstairs and
downstairs.&nbsp; I think it must be your imagination.&nbsp; I
thank my stars I have none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; replied Desprez, still humbly, but
with a return of spirit at sight of a distinction to be drawn;
&lsquo;pardon me, Casimir.&nbsp; You possess, even to an eminent
degree, the commercial imagination.&nbsp; It was the lack of that
in me&mdash;it appears it is my weak point&mdash;that has led to
these repeated shocks.&nbsp; By the commercial imagination the
financier forecasts the destiny of his investments, marks the
falling house&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Egad,&rsquo; interrupted Casimir: &lsquo;our friend the
stable-boy appears to have his share of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was silenced; and the meal was continued and
finished principally to the tune of the brother-in-law&rsquo;s
not very consolatory conversation.&nbsp; He entirely ignored the
two young English painters, turning a blind eyeglass to their
salutations, and continuing his remarks as if he were alone in
the bosom of his family; and with every second word he ripped
another stitch out of the air balloon of Desprez&rsquo;s
vanity.&nbsp; By the time coffee was over the poor Doctor was as
limp as a napkin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us go and see the ruins,&rsquo; said Casimir.</p>
<p>They strolled forth into the street.&nbsp; The fall of the
house, like the loss of a front tooth, had quite transformed the
village.&nbsp; Through the gap the eye commanded a great stretch
of open snowy country, and the place shrank in comparison.&nbsp;
It was like a room with an open door.&nbsp; The sentinel stood by
the green gate, looking very red and cold, but he had a pleasant
word for the Doctor and his wealthy kinsman.</p>
<p>Casimir looked at the mound of ruins, he tried the quality of
the tarpaulin.&nbsp; &lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I
hope the cellar arch has stood.&nbsp; If it has, my good brother,
I will give you a good price for the wines.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall start digging to-morrow,&rsquo; said the
sentry.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no more fear of snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; returned Casimir sententiously,
&lsquo;you had better wait till you get paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor winced, and began dragging his offensive
brother-in-law towards Tentaillon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the house
there would be fewer auditors, and these already in the secret of
his fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; cried Casimir, &lsquo;there goes the
stable-boy with his luggage; no, egad, he is taking it into the
inn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough, Jean-Marie was seen to cross the snowy street
and enter Tentaillon&rsquo;s, staggering under a large
hamper.</p>
<p>The Doctor stopped with a sudden, wild hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can he have?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us
go and see.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he hurried on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His luggage, to be sure,&rsquo; answered Casimir.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is on the move&mdash;thanks to the commercial
imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not seen that hamper for&mdash;for ever so
long,&rsquo; remarked the Doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor will you see it much longer,&rsquo; chuckled
Casimir; &lsquo;unless, indeed, we interfere.&nbsp; And by the
way, I insist on an examination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not require,&rsquo; said Desprez, positively
with a sob; and, casting a moist, triumphant glance at Casimir,
he began to run.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil is up with him, I wonder?&rsquo; Casimir
reflected; and then, curiosity taking the upper hand, he followed
the Doctor&rsquo;s example and took to his heels.</p>
<p>The hamper was so heavy and large, and Jean-Marie himself so
little and so weary, that it had taken him a great while to
bundle it upstairs to the Desprez&rsquo; private room; and he had
just set it down on the floor in front of Anastasie, when the
Doctor arrived, and was closely followed by the man of
business.&nbsp; Boy and hamper were both in a most sorry plight;
for the one had passed four months underground in a certain cave
on the way to Acheres, and the other had run about five miles as
hard as his legs would carry him, half that distance under a
staggering weight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jean-Marie,&rsquo; cried the Doctor, in a voice that
was only too seraphic to be called hysterical, &lsquo;is
it&mdash;?&nbsp; It is!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, my son,
my son!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he sat down upon the hamper and sobbed
like a little child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not go to Paris now,&rsquo; said Jean-Marie
sheepishly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Casimir,&rsquo; said Desprez, raising his wet face,
&lsquo;do you see that boy, that angel boy?&nbsp; He is the
thief; he took the treasure from a man unfit to be entrusted with
its use; he brings it back to me when I am sobered and
humbled.&nbsp; These, Casimir, are the Fruits of my Teaching, and
this moment is the Reward of my Life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Tiens</i>,&rsquo; said Casimir.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
